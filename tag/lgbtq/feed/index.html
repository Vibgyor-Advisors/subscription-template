<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>People whose gender identity lies beyond or between the categories of women and men – or who live and love outside the norms of heterosexuality – have been agents of change and builders of community throughout history and around the world. Across cultures and social strata, sexual and gender minorities are family members, workers, policy-makers, peacebuilders, soldiers, refugees, and ordinary people. The struggle for recognition and rights for the LGBTQ+ community has strengthened with wider movements for social justice, and the safe spaces they have forged amidst adversity have served as sites of tolerance and solidarity in often difficult times. Nonetheless, sexual and gender minority populations and communities continue to face violence and discrimination, in both conflict and peace, owing to the social norms and attitudes that denigrate their humanity and render them vulnerable.</p>



<h4><strong>System of Violence and Discrimination</strong></h4>



<p>In many societies, discrimination means that states fail to provide for the security needs of sexual and gender minority persons, leaving them in a position of vulnerability. In terms of survival mechanisms, many sexual and gender minority individuals are forced to hide their gender identity vis-à-vis other members of society and, where possible, rely on clandestine networks of trust and mutual support. Several countries still criminalize same-sex relations, but it is everyday discrimination and violence that might be the most urgent problem for LGBTQ persons. Sexual and gender minority individuals experience forced institutionalization in mental rehabilitation clinics, electroshock treatment as aversion therapy, sexual harassment in school and at work, threats of rape to make you straight, school expulsions, eviction by landlords, police kidnapping, family violence, and media stigmatization. Sexual and gender minorities face discrimination in the workplace because of their gender and their sexual orientation. Employment and job promotions are denied if women look too masculine. Male co-workers stalk and sexually harass lesbians who cannot report for fear of backlash and retaliation. Transgender variant people are marginalized in their jobs and are targeted for blackmail, harassment, and sexual violence from the community or people in positions of authority like the police. Activists who defend the rights of LGBTQ people experience threats to their safety, in some cases, harassment, attacks, even torture, and abuse, with police participating in or doing nothing to stop these violations.<strong>[i]</strong></p>



<p>Discrimination and harassment in workplaces, being denied stable employment or housing, not obtaining identity cards that indicate their chosen gender are some more issues facing the LGBTQ community. The cultural pressures and importance of family life are however the greatest obstacle. “The family unit is arguably the greatest influence on the lives of LGBTQ people, yet acceptance by families is limited by strong cultural pressures.”<strong>[ii]</strong></p>



<p>International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) reports that those who challenge sexual or gender norms often confront violence in the “private” sphere of the family. The threat of family or community rejection or recrimination often prompts people to lead double lives, making them vulnerable to police blackmail and extortion. Queer and transgender persons and other gender non-conforming people and communities face hostility, discrimination, and abuse in most places.</p>



<h4><strong>Forms of Violence and Discrimination</strong></h4>



<p>Some of the forms of violence and discrimination that sexual and gender minority individuals and communities face in conflict and peacetime can be categorized as follows:</p>



<ol><li>&nbsp;Targeted violence, including killing and sexual violence;</li><li>&nbsp;Policing of gender norms;</li><li>Blackmail and extortion; and&nbsp;</li><li>Rejection by family and other community members.</li></ol>



<p>We use this division for the sake of classification, but the differentiation between these forms of violence is somewhat forced, as in practice many of these forms occur simultaneously and/or one form might lead to another.</p>



<h4><strong>Targeted Violence against Sexual and Gender Minority Persons</strong></h4>



<p>Armed groups of very different ideological persuasions have used targeted violence like murder, against sexual and gender minority persons. The most systematic targeting was arguably that by Nazi Germany, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and trans persons from 1933 to 1945.<strong>[iii]</strong> </p>



<p>Syria and Iraq are currently among the prime groups in which targeted violence against sexual and gender minority people is most pronounced and visible. The violence committed by Islamic State, which includes the sentencing and the alleged execution of gay men by throwing them off buildings as well as targeted violence against lesbian women, has gained the most international prominence. However, other militias as well as state security forces have also targeted sexual and gender minority individuals, including specifically lesbian women in Iraq and Syria for persecution, violence, and murder.<strong>[iv]</strong></p>



<p>Nonetheless, it is not only those self-identifying as a sexual and gender minority person who is targeted. Iraqi men accused of being ‘effeminate’ and women accused of being too masculine (and therefore suspected of being gay or lesbian), based on their mannerisms, sartorial style, haircut or the like, faced violence including death, from family and community members, state security forces and militias such as the League of the Righteous (Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq) and the Mahdi Army (Jaish al-Mahdi).<strong>[v]</strong></p>



<p>Asa&#8217;ib Ahl al-Haq is an Iraqi Shi&#8217;a political party and paramilitary group active in the Iraqi insurgency and Syrian Civil War and the Mahdi Army, also known as the Jaysh al-Mahdi, is a Shiite militia which rose to international prominence in 2004 when it spearheaded the first major armed confrontation against the US forces in Iraq from the Shia community.</p>



<p>It is difficult to evaluate the degree of oppression that LGBTQ persons face in various countries in the region as there is a lack of reliable data. In Cambodia, homophobic attacks and abuse are reported in public places such as markets and clubs and in community settings.</p>



<h4><strong>Legal, Social and Ideological Frameworks of Exclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The vulnerability of sexual and gender minority communities and individuals to violence and discrimination is underpinned by legal, social, and ideological narratives and forms of exclusion, which may reduce or deny them access to the services or rights provided to other citizens. In fragile and conflict-affected states where services are often limited from the start, sexual and gender minority persons are left in one of the most vulnerable positions in society. In countries where same-sex activities are illegal, reporting sexual and gender-based violence to the police can put the victim/survivor in the position of the criminal. As of 2019, some 77 countries have laws that criminalize same-sex sexual practices, some going as far as to criminalize identities, in particular trans identities, as well as acts.<strong>[vi] </strong></p>



<p>These laws expose people who are already socially marginalized within heteronormative societies to arrest and prosecution for consensual sexual activities and their gender expressions. Criminal laws against homosexuality or other forms of non-normative sexuality also protect the perpetrators of homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic violence by restricting the ability of their victims to file complaints or press charges. Even where such laws are not enforced, as in Nigeria where a moratorium currently stands on the use of the death penalty for those convicted of homosexual acts, the existence of those laws nonetheless constitutes a form of “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” and legitimizes persecution.<strong>[vii]</strong> </p>



<p>Wherever they exist, such laws can be and at times are held over the heads of sexual and gender minority people, used not only to prosecute them but also to marginalize, blackmail, and extort them.</p>



<h4><strong>Extra-legal Harassment and Violence</strong></h4>



<p>In addition to legal criminalization and excessive use of punishment and detention, sexual and gender minority communities frequently face extra-legal harassment and violence from state security actors including police and militaries. Even in the regions of Russia, gay men claimed that they were abducted and tortured by authorities in Chechnya amid what rights groups call a brutal “purge” targeting sexual minorities in the Russian region.<strong>[viii] </strong></p>



<p>In several Eastern European countries, bombs have destroyed gay bars and right-wing parties have attacked homosexuals. A bomb exploded outside a gay club in the capital of Latvia in February 1995, for instance, and the main suspect was a member of an extremist party that called for action against homosexuals. At least 20 people were injured when the Czech Republic&#8217;s first-ever Gay Pride parade was attacked by right-wing extremists armed with tear gas in 2008.<strong>[ix] </strong></p>



<p>In Orlando, Florida a gunman attacks a gay nightclub in 2016 leaving 50 dead.<strong>[x]</strong> </p>



<p>A lack of police protection only encourages such violence. Government disregard for anti-LGBT violence is particularly blatant in Latin America. Often, the murders of gay men are labeled as “sex crimes” by the authorities, as with the 1998 murder of a prominent activist in Romania and of killings of five well-known Mexican gay men in July 1992. Equally as common is an inadequate investigation. In addition, more than 445 LGBT Brazilians died as victims of homophobia in 2017<strong>[xi]</strong></p>



<p>Homosexuals are a prime target for continuous attacks, killings, theft, blackmail, and extortion because they are still more afraid of the police than they are of the bandits. The Blue Diamond Society (BDS), which provides advocacy and assistance to sexual and gender minority people in Nepal, has noted that increases in violence against people who fall outside normative gender and sexual identities are “directly linked to the increased mobilization of military and police given the critical security situation in the country.”<strong>[xii]</strong> </p>



<p>In spite of anti-harassment regulations in the Nepali armed forces, there have been individual cases of discrimination reported against allegedly lesbian soldiers.<strong>[xiii]</strong></p>



<p>Similarly, in South Africa, some lesbian cadres in the armed wing of the African National Congress, the <em>uMkhonto we Sizwe</em>, the armed wing of the African National Congress, co-founded by Nelson Mandela in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre,[xiv] was subjected to sexual harassment, abuse, and violence by their male comrades, even was official there was a commitment to diversity.<strong>[xv]</strong></p>



<p>Globally, the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (UN OHCHR) has noted widespread assault and torture perpetrated by security forces against people identified as gay or transgender, including violence that particularly targets the features marking them as different. In a 2012 report, the UN OHCHR documented cases where trans women had been beaten on their breasts and cheekbones, where they had surgical implants, to release toxins. In Uganda and Lebanon, police and army officers have routinely extorted sexual and gender minority refugees who engage in sex work for sexual services, with threats of harm, deportation, or public outing. <strong>[xvi]</strong></p>



<h4><strong>What Policies Can Improve LGBT+ Inclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The United Nations Human Rights Council, in a defining vote, adopted a resolution on June 30, 2016, on “Protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation, and gender identity,” to mandate the appointment of an independent expert on the subject.<strong>[xvii] </strong></p>



<p>It was a historic victory for the human rights of anyone at risk of discrimination and violence because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lately, India’s highest court decision to strike down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial-era law banning gay sex, was a watershed victory in the fight for human rights. Progress like these, naturally, does not happen in a vacuum. India’s verdict directly referenced Nepal’s landmark ruling in 2007, which resulted in legal protection for LGBT+ individuals, as well as official recognition of a third gender. In subsequent years, similar legislation acknowledging a third gender was enacted in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India. Moreover, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have allowed people to change their legal gender.<strong>[xviii]</strong></p>



<p>However, discrimination and abuse against the LGBT+ community are still prevalent in the region. Decriminalization of homosexuality is only the first step of many in the battle for civil rights and wider acceptance.<strong>[xix]</strong></p>



<p>Ensuring that LGBT+ individuals can openly express their sexual orientation and gender identity without being stigmatized, discriminated against, or attacked should be a policy priority, for at least three reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The first and most important reason is obviously ethical.</strong> Sexual orientation and gender identity are integral aspects of ourselves. Guaranteeing that LGBT people are not condemned to forced concealment or retaliation when their identity is revealed should constitute an inalienable human right.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The second reason is economic</strong>. The exclusion of LGBT+ people impedes economic development through a wide range of channels, such as lower investment in human capital, reduced output, and productivity, public spending on social and health services that might be better spent elsewhere.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The third reason why LGBT+ inclusion should constitute a priority is social.</strong> LGBT+ inclusion is viewed as conducive to the emergence of less restrictive gender norms that improve gender equality broadly speaking and, hence, expand social and economic roles, especially for women.<strong>[xx] </strong>Consistent with this intuition, acceptance of homosexuality is strongly correlated with support for gender equality worldwide.</li><li><strong>Making LGBT+ individuals and the discrimination they face visible in national statistics&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>Awarding the world that LGBT+ individuals constitute a sizable minority that is discriminated against is an important prerequisite in order to improve their inclusion. Greater publicity of discriminatory behavior can indeed bring meaningful change, in particular through greater self-control of discriminating individuals.</p>



<p>Collecting information on sexual orientation and gender identity in censuses as well as national labor force, health, and victimization surveys are critical to creating awareness. However, only a minority of OECD countries (15) have included such questions in at least one of their nationally representative surveys, and even fewer (11 countries) do so on a regular basis. Yet, these countries constitute helpful precedents that contribute to disseminate good practices on how to best collect such sensitive information. The United Kingdom is, for instance, planning to include a question on sexual self-identification in its 2021 census.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enforcing Anti-Discrimination and Equality Laws</strong></li></ul>



<p>Legally prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination and ensuring equal rights to LGBT+ individuals is essential for their inclusion. One cannot expect to improve the situation of sexual and gender minorities if, to begin with, the law does not protect them against discrimination and abuses. As an illustration, LGBT+ employees report lower perceived discrimination and are more comfortable being open about their sexual orientation in firms that ban discrimination against them. LGBT+ employees also declare greater job commitment, improved workplace relationships, increased job satisfaction, and better health outcomes in these settings. Recently, the top court in the US has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country&#8217;s civil rights laws.<strong>[xxi]</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Educating People in Countering their Unconscious Biases</strong></li></ul>



<p>Unconscious bias training should constitute a key component of any policy package aiming to improve LGBT+ inclusion. This training consists of making individuals aware of their unconscious prejudices and stereotypes and teaching them how to overcome them. Increasing attention is being devoted to training recruiters, managers, and employees at large.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</h4>



<p>There is still a long way to go before lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender individuals meet full-fledged legal acceptance. LGBT+ people are still stigmatized and exposed to various forms of discrimination, despite the fact that some LGBT+ individuals managed to make it to the top. Discrimination is not only ethically unacceptable; it also entails substantial economic and social costs. Examining violence and discrimination against sexual and gender minority persons will help us understand better, the gendered dynamics behind exclusionary politics and violence. Laws prohibiting same-sex relations are found in the penal codes of many countries in the world. Although few cases are actually prosecuted under these laws, such criminalization contributes to the stigmatization of LGBT individuals in the media, public, and the workplace.</p>
