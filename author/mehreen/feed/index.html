<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Water is an essential natural resource. It is a basic requirement for the survival of living organisms. Clean drinking water is important for a healthy life. Even though more than 70% of Earth is covered by water, less than three percent of the water covering the earth is freshwater, and the bulk of that is not even accessible as that is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Therefore, very less (approximately 1%) is available for our day to day consumption and fulfilling our various needs. Thus, while we may think that water will always be available in abundance, it is not so, instead, scarcity of <strong>fresh water is one of the</strong> <strong>major environmental problems of the 21st century.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Water Scarcity: A Global Crisis</strong></h4>



<p>Nothing is more essential than water on earth. Yet, according to an estimation of the World Health Organisation, it has been seen that almost 700 million people, i.e. 1 in 10 people, lack access to water, and almost 4 billion people experience water scarcity at least one month in a year. Though water scarcity is a global issue, it has been found that it affected developing and underdeveloped countries the most. In some countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, less than half the population has access to clean water. The condition is so grave that the ‘World Economic Forum’ has ranked the water crisis as the top biggest risk to humanity and human economics. Even the United Nations has said that two-thirds of the human population is going to face water scarcity by 2025.</p>



<p>Water scarcity can range from a challenging but manageable water shortage to a full-blown water crisis. Further, when it comes to the <strong>classification of water scarcity</strong>, for better understanding, it is classified into physical water scarcity and economic water scarcity.</p>



<p><strong>Physical water scarcity </strong>or <strong>Absolute water scarcity refers to </strong>a situation when there isn&#8217;t an adequate amount of water available to meet the demand, i.e. demand outpaces the limited water resources available in a given region.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Economic water scarcity refers to</strong> water scarcity which occurs primarily because of poor infrastructure or mismanagement of water resources. It may also arise due to unregulated use of water in agriculture or industry, at the expense of the general population.</p>

<h4><strong>What Causes Water Scarcity? </strong></h4>



<p>The rate at which we are moving towards a global water crisis which seems to be irrevocable is alarming. Though we rely on water for our survival, we as humans are the biggest contributors to the present crisis. Water systems are increasingly stressed, and some rivers, lakes, and other water bodies are drying up due to a variety of causes, many of which are a result of human activity. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the chief causes of water scarcity in the world are discussed below:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Pollution:</strong> UN World Water Assessment Program estimated in 2003 that every day, 2 million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged into the world’s water, the equivalent of the weight of the entire human population. The portable water which is already present at very low levels is further made unfit for consumption by pollution. Almost 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to drink water that is contaminated from feces as per the UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. Further, hundreds of millions of people worldwide are strained to consume water that is dangerously, chemically polluted as well. <strong>The chart below identifies some of the chief sources of water contamination.</strong></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZALKE_O29xkZHXqLbANPiC_VhRRPAww4dipbjAjenScRZrck9e_5ZMhIVIC74y92-tz2Qb6V1ZErOv-pnFaBMDh4zywX8JgDLN12dg8n4W3f-rOlExml8OeVq125Vzh5uiIOVtvz" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Causes of Water Pollution</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Climate Change: </strong>Over the last 25 years, floods, droughts, and other weather-related events have caused more than 90% of major weather-related disasters. Such events are further expected to increase in severity and frequency with climate change. InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that climate change over the 21st century may reduce the renewable water resources significantly in many dry sub-tropical regions. If the existing climate change pattern continues, UN WWDR 2009 (World Water Development Report) reveals, by 2030 water scarcity in some arid and semi-arid places will displace around 700 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Population Growth: </strong>It has been witnessed that population growth has doubled up in almost the last 50 yrs. Because of such fast growth, there has been an increase in demand for water consumption. This rapid growth with industrialization over years has adversely affected the water ecosystem. As the global water supply remains fixed and consumption increases it ultimately leads to water shortage.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qyKJRrl4m2LACM4RR3Su_IRaRt7uwe3hfivBzBrfGHhsGynZECrwiGLLoHkDg4uHaSMFHGUQ8en6WNiy6e3kBwfpWaohd_5NZMM7iz1BHPvh1zaNnhzLnCD9mAFel2YZuu4Qx6bi" alt=""/></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Wastage of Water: </strong>It has been on record that there is excessive use of water which leads to its wastage.<strong> </strong>In a mapped study done by NASA, it was revealed that 21 of the world’s major 37 water sources are distressed, mostly because of overuse from human consumption. The amount of wastewater produced annually is approximately 6 times more water than exists in all rivers of the world, i.e., about 1500 km³. People who have unlimited access to water use it indiscriminately without even thinking about those who are deprived of such a blessing.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Uneven Distribution of Water Resources:&nbsp;</strong>Due to the uneven distribution of potable water across the globe many areas face shortage of water. Most of North America, Europe, Brazil, and even parts of Africa, currently have more than enough renewable freshwater. Other regions are desperately under-served, like North Africa, Middle East, India, Mexico, large portions of South America and many Islands.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6eNMRTQXXUdzn-A_xHc5g0Vz6LWH8pPaC-XN6-OYUUN44KxLzqiU_9SyLPeJnHTOOUla2cdOCxxTcfcWR8N1EqgkHkBvUPnyOieijDkdUqPVFoSyTiyMYqPD-V4PM9g0XnJcHZ9X" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>What are the Consequences of Water Scarcity? </strong></h4>



<p>Indiscriminate use of water and reckless behavior of human beings has resulted in acute water scarcity which has caused calamitous effects. It has been estimated that by 2040, not much water would be available to meet the demand of humans as well as ecosystems.</p>



<p><strong>Some effects of water scarcity are listed below:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Food Shortage: </strong>Shortage of water has a grave impact on agricultural production. Agricultural production being a basic necessity that requires almost 70% of water, suffers gravely due to the shortage of water. With the increase in population and scarcity of water, it gets difficult to meet food demands, crop yield gets low. This can give rise to starvation and also leads to higher food costs.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GFVCEo1pSpZKbN453XPoN-3QuT34-XTQ-mfbhfseX5KvJsEmQDlgCbQDQyFnJ6eJIHvvD8efvCa25pL-7OKoNViD3VDIbGrJcpG-bD5aC_BMvdbtZ_-D8FgvVH7_mALKO7_Z_Ynn" alt="" width="657" height="475"/></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Health and Wellbeing:</strong> The scarcity of water affects healthy hygiene and proper sanitation which gives rise to numerous health-related and other problems. UNICEF in 2019 reported,&nbsp; 2 out of 5 people worldwide do not have a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home, and half of the global population lack safely managed sanitation services. Further,&nbsp; people living in areas with contaminated water are more likely to be infected by deadly water-borne diseases such as cholera, hepatitis, diarrhea, etc., with <strong>almost 1 million people dying every year from water</strong>, sanitation, and hygiene-related diseases. Also, every 2 minutes a child dies from a water-borne disease with diarrhea being one of the top causes, contributing an estimate of around 1.5 million deaths every year.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Threatened Ecosystem: </strong>Water scarcity has directly affected flora and fauna across the Globe, especially the disappearing of wetlands and damaging ecosystems. According to research by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), about half of the world’s wetlands have been destroyed since 1900. Due to scarcity of water, the ecosystem has imbalanced which resulted in the shrinking of sea bodies, in many areas seas have disappeared and left out is polluted land. &nbsp;Also, UNESCO reported in 2017 that 80% of wastewater flows back to the ecosystems without being treated or reused. Thus, the biological health keeps on deteriorating with the native plant and animal species becoming extinct.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Economic Slowdown:</strong> Shortage of water slows down economic activities. As suggested by a report of Water.Org, an estimated $260 billion is lost annually due to a lack of basic water and sanitation. Lack of freshwater, which is of primary use in agricultural and industrial activities, results in decreased outputs and increased prices, which in turn results in poverty and hence, a negative impact on the economy.</li><li><strong>Impact on Women and Children:</strong> Across the Globe women and children are worst hit by water scarcity. Mostly it has been seen that they bear the primary responsibility for collecting water and according to Water.Org, they spend a collective of 200 million hours a day collecting water. While women, like those in Sub-Saharan Africa, are responsible for collecting more than 70% of water, face negative impacts on their health, education, and safety, children also miss their schools because they have to spend hours collecting water. Likewise, poor sanitation keeps kids, especially girls, from being able to go to school. In many countries when girls reach the age of puberty and start menstruating they leave school, as there is a lack of water in restrooms and they have no other facilities to redress their needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increased Global Conflict:</strong> The increasing scarcity of water in the world has become a major cause of conflict. The World Economic Forum listed the water crisis at number four among the top ten risks faced by the world for 8 consecutive years. It can be weaponized and used to destroy or redirect access to water by countries to meet their objectives by targeting infrastructure and supplies. As per the Pacific Institute&#8217;s Water Conflict Chronology, out of 926 conflicts that have occurred in the past decade, 466 were related to water. The main water-related reasons that lead to conflict include; dependency on one major water source, disputes over dams, reservoirs, and other large scale projects. In fact, a new study by NASA interpreted that World War III is going to be fought over the scarcity of water if things don’t change soon.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Water Scarcity: Management</strong></h4>



<p>The urgent crisis that is unfolding before the world in the form of water scarcity requires an equally urgent response. Different international actors such as the UN and its agencies have been working tirelessly to ensure that the basic need of life, i.e., water is made available to all. Accordingly, the United Nations under its Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) calls for clean water and sanitation for all people.<strong> It aims to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” at least by 2030. </strong>Management of the crisis, however, becomes more important in areas that are most water-stressed, such as the <strong>Middle East</strong>, <strong>North Africa</strong>, and <strong>Asia</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>Middle East </strong>and<strong> North Africa </strong>(<strong>MENA</strong>) is the world&#8217;s most water-scarce region with total water productivity being only about half the world’s average. This region is the home to the top 10 worst-hit countries by water scarcity (Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iran, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E.).&nbsp; The situation there is worsening due to the impacts of conflict, climate change, and economic downturn. The World Bank has estimated that this region has the greatest expected economic losses from climate-related water scarcity, approximately up to 14% of GDP by 2050. The water crisis threatens the region’s stability as well as its human development and sustainable growth. Flood and drought risks are increasing and are likely to harm the poor disproportionately. However, the region is gearing up to deal with the challenge on several fronts. Some countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Palestine have approved national water resources plans. Other countries have developed frameworks that contain elements of policy, in the form of strategy or master plans. The region, being mostly dependent on transboundary water resources, is beginning to recognize the importance of an integrated approach to water management. <strong>The Gulf Cooperation Council countries ( Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., etc.) collect and treat almost 84% of the wastewater generated there</strong>. Some huge projects are also being developed to cope with water stress, for example,<strong> Qatar</strong> has started its “Water Security Mega Reservoirs Project” to store portable water as per the expected consumption rates in 2036; <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> launched the “Qatrah (water droplet in Arabic) Program” which sets to conserve water and reduce water usage by approximately 40-50% within the next decade.</p>



<h4><strong>What’s the situation in Asia?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Asia</strong> which is currently home to 4.5 billion people uses around 65% of the world’s water supply. Around 30% of the Asian population is already facing water scarcity. As a result of population growth, industrial development, and urbanization, the water crisis has become particularly acute. Many river basins already are unable to fulfill the demand for water that they face. According to the research of the International Institute for Applied System Analysis’ (IIASA) Water Program, by 2050, the water scarcity will further increase in almost 70 to 80% of the Asian regions. The problem in the region, however, has not been so much because of a shortage of water, as it has been because of poor management of the water resources and infrastructure. Nevertheless, in recent years, the countries have realized the gravity of the situation and have started taking some stern measures to deal with the crisis. Some of the worst affected countries in the regions, such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, China, Singapore, etc. have taken the lead in handling the situation through making new laws, designing new projects, and adopting new methods. <strong>Indian Government in 2019 set up a new ministry, the ‘Jal Shakti Ministry’, to prioritize the provision of clean drinking water for all</strong>, Pakistan drafted a National Water Policy and ‘Pakistan Water Charter’ to plan, develop, monitor, coordinate and manage its water resources. Countries such as China, Nepal, and <strong>Indonesia</strong> developed major projects to curtail the scarcity of water and to meet the increasing demands of their people, such as the ‘Mega Water Diversion Project’, the ‘Melamchi Drinking Water Project’ and the ‘National Urban Water Supply Project’ respectively.</p>



<p>Though the task at hand is very challenging, however, the current approach of the governments certainly has the capability of producing fruitful results for the people of this region in particular and of the world in general.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years there have been many academic studies, governmental policies, industrial plans, and much more to improve the management of water, reduction of inefficient use of water and to avoid a global crisis of water, yet, the world is still facing a problem of looming global water crisis. Although the situation concerning the availability of water is very bad and it may seem to be beyond any repair, it is important to know that the water crisis is solvable. Water is a renewable resource and therefore, lack of access to water isn’t a law of nature.<strong> Instead, it is just a matter of management, efficiency, regulations, infrastructure, funding, and most importantly, it’s a matter of sincerity in people’s efforts to preserve water resources and to prevent further depletion</strong>. In fact, studies also suggest that water scarcity can be reduced significantly by 2050 if the world commits to make some big, and practical changes. These changes, however, have to be multidisciplinary, which means that the water resources must be managed with a goal of ensuring equity in the economy and social welfare without compromising with the ecosystem.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Therefore, there have to be&nbsp; threefold solutions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Environmental policy:</strong> preservation and restoration of ecosystems as they naturally collect, store, filter and release water, such as wetlands and forests.</li><li><strong>Economic </strong>and <strong>Social solutions: </strong>improvement of environmental infrastructure and shifting to organic farming and other sustainable methods to reduce pollution.</li><li><strong>Engineering Technologies: </strong>designing technologies to benefit the environment and address water scarcity issues, such as improving irrigation technologies, rainwater harvesting, etc.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Gulf countries or the “Arabian Gulf” is a group of Arab states that border the Persian Gulf or, in simple terms it is often understood as the group of ‘oil-producing states’ surrounding the Persian Gulf which is a shallow marginal sea in the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Peninsula and southeastern Iran. It is a set of seven countries namely:</p>



<ol><li>Bahrain</li><li>Iraq</li><li>Kuwait</li><li>Oman</li><li>Qatar</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>United Arab Emirates<br>All these countries, except Iraq, are members of the Gulf Cooperation Committee (GCC), a regional intergovernmental organization to foster economic, scientific, and business cooperation among the member countries, and have a lot of things in common, for example, their food styles, values, cultures, etc. However, the main difference lies in their political structures. These countries form some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, mostly due to a boom in oil, natural gas, and petroleum revenues. They also dominate other OPEC ( The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries in oil production and are among the wealthiest countries of the world, on a per capita basis.</li></ol>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="384" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Q9gBDFcL5KOdhTYwf0rHdNDPaYpE5XK9MSCLeQxUKoM5-KawRCw8GQaXZx67lPgD6LdNOylIpoLpjVaizFHr5pcibQX0fs5Aunir8pe36PnXTZ0MbZ4pkB4EQmx62l4U5Ygs-A"></p>



<p><em>According to current estimates, 79.4% of the world&#8217;s proven oil reserves are located in OPEC Member Countries, with the bulk of OPEC oil reserves in the Middle East, amounting to 64.5% of the OPEC total.</em></p>



<h4><strong>A Brief History</strong></h4>



<p>“Discovery of oil” in the Gulf is what has shaped all the affairs of the region, be it history, economy, or polity. In the Gulf region, oil was first found in 1927 in northern Iraq, followed by Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and others over the years.<br>However, considering the importance and the value of the resource that was found there, the greed (amongst the Gulf countries) to take control over all oil reserves and to rule the world, lead to a number of wars, which ultimately resulted in the western intervention in their affairs and left some serious long-term implications on their internal structures, leading to the instability that is witnessed today.<br>• <strong>The Iran-Iraq War</strong></p>



<p>The roots of the Iran- Iraq War (1980-88) lay in a number of territorial and political disputes between Iraq and Iran. However, mainly Iraq wanted to seize control of the rich oil-producing Iranian border region of Khūzestān, a territory inhabited largely by ethnic Arabs. In September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded through a broad front into Khūzestān and captured the city of Khorramshahr but failed to take the important oil-refining center of Ābādān. Iran’s counterattacks began to compel the Iraqis to give ground in 1981. Later in the year 1982, Iraq voluntarily withdrew its forces from all captured Iranian territory and began seeking a peace agreement with Iran. However, the violence continued while both the nations still engaged in sporadic air and missile attacks against each other’s cities and military and oil installations. They also attacked each other’s oil-tanker shipping in the Persian Gulf. The Iran-Iraq war finally ended in 1988 only after the United Nations-brokered a ceasefire.<br>• <strong>The Gulf War</strong></p>



<p>In August 1990, Iraq invaded the country of Kuwait to its southeast in a bid to gain more control over the lucrative oil supply of the Middle East. Alarmed by these actions, fellow Arab powers such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt called on the United States and other Western nations to intervene. The then Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein defied United Nations Security Council&#8217;s demands to withdraw from Kuwait by mid-January 1991, and the Persian Gulf War began with a massive U.S.-led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm. After 42 days of relentless attacks by the allied coalition in the air and on the ground, the then U.S. President George H.W. Bush declared a cease-fire on February 28, 1991; by that time, most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled. Although, as a result of this war Kuwait was liberated, before leaving Iraqi soldiers set fire to about 500 oil wells and dumped millions of gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf, leading to an environmental crisis.</p>

<p>The end of the Gulf war did not, however, mark the end of the involvement of the United States in the Middle East, rather, towards the end of the twentieth century, the foreign policy of the United States and other western nations became more and more netted in the politics of the Gulf.</p>



<h4><strong>The Western Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>The Western intervention in the Middle East started after the end of World War I (WWI) and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. When the allies won WWI, the Middle East was divided between Britain and France according to their own interests rather than those of the ethnic groups of the region. After World War II (WWII), they did not continue in the Gulf and left, but the borders they had created remained. However, after WWII, the US started its involvement when it started to see its interests in the region. Using terrorism as a tactic and growth of OPEC and the use of oil in political ways, it began intervening in the affairs of the Gulf. The presence of oil in the region also found Britain, France, the European Union (EU), and other Western allies carving their ways into the Gulf. As already mentioned, the Gulf War gave the most sought after opportunity to the Western forces to lay their foot on the Arabian soil and shape its internal structures in every manner to support their interests.</p>



<p><strong>Iraq:</strong> On September 11, 2001, an Islamic terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, attacked the World Trade Centre in New York resulting in the killing of thousands of civilians. The US accused Iraq of supplying weapons of mass destruction to Al-Qaeda and on the pretext of seizing those weapons, the US and the allied forces attacked and occupied the Iraqi land in 2003, at the cost of savage bloodshed and mass destruction. The country came under full western control, there were armed forces bases set up, air force patrolling, etc. The US kept building up its strength in Iraq over the years to tens of thousands of soldiers until the end of 2011 when it finally started to withdraw because it did not find any strong evidence to support its claim. The role played by America and Britain post-2003 resulted in a feeling of anger and distress among Iraqis and led fundamentalist organizations to flourish, especially the Islamic State of Iraq. As a result, the US redeployed its forces in Iraq and tried to legitimize its presence in the region on various pretexts, such as protecting US officials and facilities in Iraq, helping the natives to defend themselves, and preventing a possible genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.</p>



<p>Besides Iraq, Western presence has been profound in Yemen, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and UAE as well. “Arab Spring”, which was a series of anti-governmental uprisings in the Arab world in response to the oppressive regimes and low standards of living, paved a way for the Western forces, especially the US, to further its influence in the Gulf countries like Yemen and Bahrain, apart from other Middle-East countries. The slogans which dominated the uprising were <strong>“liberty”, “dignity”, “jobs” </strong>and an<strong> “end to corruption”</strong>. The West apparently identified with these slogans and felt it was on the same side with protesters. But, it had its own interests as well &#8211; the European Union (EU) wanted to stop the Arab migration, which is viewed as a potential source of social tension, into the EU. The US had its strategic interests in the region as it is a vital global energy resource. Besides, the area was of strategic military importance for the US, France, and Britain. The US has installed some of its major army camps in Kuwait (Arifjanin and Buehring camps) and Qatar(Aaliyah camp). Besides, the US air force also maintains installations in Kuwait, UAE, and Qatar along with navy deployments in the region. Apart from this, thousands of troops have been deployed in various states across the Gulf region. It maintains stationing of several dozen personnel in Oman as well.<br>Further, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> has maintained a close relationship with the United States since its inception, given that it was the chief country that called for Western interference in the first place(during the Gulf War). The Saudi-US relations stem from the economics of oil because Saudi holds about a quarter of the world’s known oil reserves. However, some say that it is US hypocrisy because Saudi is a monarchy and its very setup is the antithesis to democracy but the US is still maintaining its ties. The US has been staying back in Saudi, saying it is concerned about the latter’s security, even though there is no formal defense agreement between the two countries. Since the 1990&#8217;s the US has been deploying tens of thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia for its defense against Iraq, and also providing ammunition as well as military training to its army. It also claims to have undertaken several counter-terrorism operations in the region along with the Saudi regime. Even though in recent times the relations of the two have not been really good, but, the military alliance between the two continues. In March 2015, President Barack Obama even declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a &#8220;Joint Planning Cell&#8221; with Saudi Arabia.</p>



<h4><strong>Consequences of Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>Ensuring the free flow of oil represents perhaps the most constant US interest in the Middle East. Europe, China, and Japan all also depend on oil imports for their energy needs. Therefore, since at least the 1970s, America’s key strategic interests in the region have involved not only securing easy access for itself but also guaranteeing an open and secure market for Japan and Europe. No doubt, the presence of Western agencies has had some positive influences on the otherwise non-democratic and non-liberal Gulf regimes and it has to a very great extent helped in the development of these countries as well. However, the fact remains, that intervention in any country&#8217;s internal affairs beyond a particular level becomes undesirable and produces contravening and destabilizing effects on that country. Similarly, years of Western intervention in the Gulf has left its ill impacts on the region on various fronts. </p>



<p><strong>Given under are some of the unfortunate effects of Western Intervention in various Gulf regions:</strong><br>• The continuous presence and intervention of the US in Iraq have had grave results on all fronts, be it humanitarian, political, economic, or cultural. Ever since 2003, millions of people have been displaced, thousands killed, nearly one-third of the population living in poverty, making it one of the biggest catastrophes of the world. The US with its entry also gave a blow to the state-owned factories and enterprises by introducing foreign investments and gradually resulted in an unprecedented increase in unemployment of the natives. Further, it also destroyed the cultural heritage of Iraq with its art museums and other important cultural institutions being damaged during the early occupation. Also, the Western presence was supposed to bring about a democratic reform but, even today, democracy remains a dream. Instead, it has increased terrorism and sectarian violence and also increased competition and rivalries amongst various regional actors. Thus, as far as Iraq is concerned, an intervention (from the West) which was justified on humanitarian grounds, resulted in a grossly negative impact and distorted its entire structure, while not even serving altogether fruitful for the US as well, as it also suffered huge loss over the years while engaging in various warfares in Iraq.</p>



<p>• Even though there has been no direct uprising against the presence of the US in Arab, but, there has been growing resentment among the masses against it. In such circumstances, supporting the Western presence by some Arab nations has resulted in an ever-developing feeling of humiliation and a strong sense of loss in the populace. Western presence has also been used by terrorist organizations to radicalize young men. This sentiment if not addressed seriously can result in further unrest in the region and may even result in a popular revolt, destroying the social, political, and economical structure very badly.<br>• As a <strong>result of the intervention</strong>, just like in Iraq, inherent tribal, sectarian, and ethnic conflicts in other countries also have intensified. Further, it has resulted in pressure upon the Arab world from two opposite directions, one, the originally Islamic Fundamentalist ideology, and two, the ‘’ democracy’’ and ‘’freedom’’ ideas promoted by Western powers.</p>



<p>• <strong>According to the United Nations</strong>, as a result of the Saudi led airstrikes in Yemen (which is in a state of war over the transition of power), 7,700 civilian deaths have taken place till March 2020, and currently Yemen is experiencing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. In doing so, the coalition has received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK, and France.</p>

<p><em>More than 60% of civilian deaths have been the result of Saudi-led airstrikes, the UN says [EPA]</em></p>



<p>• In <strong>Bahrain</strong>, where there was an uprising, mainly sectarian, to overthrow the existing regime in 2014, the US, along with Saudi again, cracked down upon the people seeking their rights. It adopted a policy of blanketing Manama, the capital of Bahrain, and surrounding villages with tanks and armored personnel carriers, using live ammunition as well as tear gas and rubber bullets to break up demonstrations. Even though the uprising was in its favor as it encouraged the ‘democratic sentiment’ but, it suppressed it forcefully in order to secure its larger interest, that is, its relations with Saudi Arabia. Therefore, it can be said that on one hand, the west pretends to maintain the presence of authoritarian regimes as far as it serves its interest. On the other, it prefers to pretend as if it upholds the principle of democracy by popular voices and choices in the Arab world.<br>International intervention is a common phenomenon in international relations. In the modern era of globalization and technological development, intervention by various international actors such as the United Nations and other international organizations are somewhat indispensable in order to bring about coordination in the international community and also to ensure equality and justice at the global level. However, intervention is of two types, “power intervention” and “well-intentioned intervention”. Power intervention means “interference” in the affairs of another country, whereas, well-intentioned intervention is intervening with a positive approach. The intervention thus, must with an intention to help the region to progress and to diffuse the long-existing crisis and must be up to a certain level. But, the Western intervention in the Gulf has been ‘power intervention’. At the international level, the sovereignty of a nation is the most sacred principle, respecting the authority and supremacy of a nation with respect to its internal affairs is the obligation of every other nation. Intervening to a point where it infringes the sovereignty of that country is condemnable and produces most often, devastating results, as can be witnessed in the Gulf today. A region that was supposed to be so well developed and rich is reeling under an unprecedented conflict and humanitarian crisis, as a result of years of uncontrolled Western intervention. Therefore, the international community must unite and call upon the West to withdraw from the Gulf and help it rejuvenate its culture, economy, polity, and ultimately bring about stability.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p><strong>Who are Rohingyas?</strong></p>



<p>Rohingyas are one of the many ethnic minorities of Myanmar which constitute its largest Muslim percentage. As the statistics suggest, before August 2017, nearly 1 million Rohingyas, which accounts for about one-third of the population, resided in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. Apart from that, almost 3.5 million Rohingyas are dispersed worldwide.</p>



<p>Myanmar, which is a majority-Buddhist state, considers Rohingya Muslims as “Bangladeshis” and does not recognise them as its citizens. They were not even included in the 2014 census. Over the years, Myanmar has been accused of committing grave human rights violations and atrocities on Rohingyas such as torture, rape, enforced disappearances, destruction of properties, etc. forcing them to flee to different neighbouring countries, especially, Bangladesh. According to the most recently available data, more than 168,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since 2012.</p>



<h4>History of the Rohingya Crisis</h4>



<p>The conflict dates back to 1948 (after Myanmar’s independence from British rule) when the Union Citizenship Act passed by the government, excluding Rohingyas from its ambit, lead to a Muslim rebellion in the Rakhine state. This Act, however, allowed Rohingyas who had been living in Myanmar for two generations or more to apply for identity cards. But, in 1982, a new Citizenship Act was passed which identified 135 national, ethnic groups, excluding Rohingyas altogether. Thus, rendering them completely ‘stateless’. This led to another popular uprising followed by a military crackdown on the Rohingyas from 1989-1991, as a result of which, around 250,000 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh. </p>



<p>The conflict between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in the Rakhine state intensified in 2012 when the Arakanese political party along with the Buddhist monks and ordinary Arakanese attacked Rohingya and Kaman Muslim communities. In this violence, many were killed and buried in mass graves, and more than 1,00,000 people fled to Malaysia. In 2014, Myanmar conducted its first census in 30 years, and still not included Rohingyas as an ethnic group.<br>As a result, the Arkani Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked a border post of Myanmar security forces in 2016, which was again followed by a military crackdown on innocent Rohingya civilians. During the crackdown, about 87,000 people fled to Bangladesh. However, the tension intensified to even greater levels in August 2017 after the Rohingya militia (ARSA) attacked more than 30 police posts on August 25, 2017. The Myanmar army responded by launching an unprecedented and deadly attack on the Rohingya community. At least 6,700 Rohingyas, including 730 Children under 5 years of age, were killed in that month according to Medicine San Frontiers (MSF) and more than 700,000 Rohingya fled from Myanmar. In 2018 after the UN scaled its response (after the 2017 mass exodus) and accused the Myanmar military of atrocities against Rohingya Muslims, Bangladesh and Myanmar government offered refugees a chance to return to Myanmar. However, not even a single person returned, fearing their lives. In 2019, there was further violence which led to the displacement of another 4,500 Rohingya people.</p>

<h4>The Bangladesh Crisis:</h4>



<p>This Rohingya refugee crisis is among the largest, fastest movements of people in recent history. As a result of August 2017 violence during which indiscriminate and widespread attacks and killings were perpetrated by the Myanmar security forces against the Rohingyas, which was referred to as the “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” by the UN Human Rights Commissioner, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar have fled to Bangladesh. They joined another almost 300,000 refugees who had fled years before to escape the violence in Myanmar. </p>



<p>This mass movement has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh with nearly 1 million Rohingyas taking refuge there in various camps along the border. Today, about 860,000 Rohingya refugees live in Kutapalong refugee camps which form the largest and most densely populated refugee settlement of the world according to UNHCR. Cox’ Bazar district follows next with about 850,000 refugees take shelter there. By September 2019, around 914,000 Rohingya were estimated to need assistance as most of those, especially women and children, who are arriving in Bangladesh, are traumatized and mostly injured by gunshots, shrapnel, fire, and landmines.</p>



<p>This entire situation has resulted in a great strain on the resources of Bangladesh. As such, on April 23, 2020, Bangladesh’s Foreign Minister, Abdul Moen said the country would refuse entry to more Rohingya. This decision resulted in aggravation in the crisis as the Rohingya people were left with nowhere to go! However, the UN intervened immediately with UNHCR raising serious concerns about the push-backs, urging ‘greater coordination and responsibility-sharing by states to address the maritime movements of refugees and asylum Seekers protected man Sea. Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said, “Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina has called herself the ‘Mother of Humanity’ for offering protection to Rohingya fleeing Myanmar, but now her government is turning its back on these refugees”. Human Rights Watch also has said that “Bangladesh should continue to uphold its international obligations not to return refugees to places where they face persecution and to return anyone to where they would face a risk of torture or ill-treatment”.</p>

<h4>Relief Programs</h4>



<p>There are over 200 aid agencies operating in the Rohingya camps. With a few exceptions, who are allegedly involved in corruption and nepotism, these agencies have been working tirelessly over the years to provide all sorts of humanitarian and other assistance to the refugees living in various camps in Bangladesh. </p>



<p>WHO, UNICEF, UNOCHA, OXFAM, MSF, Save the Children, World Vision are some of the prominent UN agencies and NGOs working in refugee camps in Bangladesh. These organisations broadly provide aid through:<br><strong>• Providing health services,</strong> including life-saving drugs, maternal and child-care services, emergency medical services.<br>•<strong> Nutrition:</strong> these agencies, with their nutrition experts, provide proper nutritious diets to refugees, especially children, and pregnant women, to prevent malnutrition.<br>• <strong>Child protection and education: </strong>they also work towards the safety of children against various illnesses such as diarrhea, respiratory illnesses, by providing proper medical care. Besides, they provide protection against various forms of exploitation such as child marriage, sexual violence, physical violence, and human trafficking.<br><strong>• Education: </strong>in collaboration with UNICEF, many NGOs have been providing informal education to the children in refugee camps, especially between ages 3-14, besides providing vocational training to adolescents aged 15-18.<br>• <strong>Installing sewage facilities</strong>, water points, toilets, showers, distributing sanitation products such as soaps and other essentials, installing solar-powered lights, etc.</p>



<h4>Government Policies</h4>



<h4>Myanmar:</h4>



<p>The Myanmar government does not recognise Rohingyas as citizens of Myanmar. It considers them as ‘Bangladeshis’ and refers to them as ‘Bengalis’. The World Report released by the Human Rights Watch in 2019 reported, “The Rohingya refugees who fled in 2018 reported that Myanmar authorities had ordered them to accept the National Verification Card – which does not provide citizenship – or leave Myanmar. Successive governments have for decades deprived Rohingya of nationality through systematic and institutionalized marginalization, rendering them stateless.” Earlier in 2017, the Myanmar state officials even went to an extent of altogether denying the existence of Rohingyas.<br>“There is no such thing as Rohingya”, said U Kyaw San Hla, an officer in the state security ministry. “It&#8217;s fake news”.<br>Human rights watchdogs have warned there is a danger of the Rohingya history being eradicated by the military campaigns. In a report released in October 2019, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said that Myanmar’s security forces had worked to “effectively erase all signs of memorable landmarks in the geography of the Rohingya landscape and memory in such a way that a return to their lands would yield nothing but a desolate and unrecognizable terrain”. The report also said the crackdown in Rakhine had targeted teachers, cultural and religious leadership, and other people of influence in the Rohingya community in an effort to diminish Rohingya&#8217;s history, culture, and knowledge”.<br>However, Myanmar has been denying almost all the allegations of human rights violations or other violence against Rohingyas. It says the 2017 military crackdown was a direct response to the ARSA militant attacks. Myanmar’s security officials accepted the killing of 10 Rohingya men in September 2017 in Inn Din Village only after the massacre was ‘exposed’ by the media. A year later, in September 2018, two journalists were convicted for breaking the state’s secret laws and sentenced to 7 years in prison.<br>Myanmar, in an attempt to hide the reality from the world, continues to bar international investigators, including the UN-mandated fact-finding mission and UN’s special rapporteur for the country, Yanghee Lee, to probe the violence on its soil.</p>



<h4>Bangladesh:</h4>



<p>Bangladesh lacks the wealth and infrastructure necessary to deal with a disaster of the scale it now confronts: it is an overpopulated and underdeveloped country that is prone to natural disasters and rising sea levels. The country is now struggling to cope with the pressure of hosting approximately 1 million stateless Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar. Nevertheless, Bangladeshis have largely united in support of the Rohingya refugees. In a rare show of agreement, opposition parties backed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s decision to shelter the Rohingya fleeing violence, at least for the time being. However, taking it as a short-term challenge, without any long-term planning or a blueprint for the future for the State to act on, could not produce any successful outcomes, with the crisis deepening every day. Although Bangladesh started with a very positive approach, such as when the violence against Rohingya refugees began to rise in Southern Bangladesh, the Central Government reacted very stringently. It put strict retractions on refugees and NGO’s that interfered with the humanitarian assistance in the camps. However, recently, Bangladesh began to impose new restrictions on refugees and NGOs working in the camps, such as restrictions on freedom of movement and the use of mobile phones. <strong>“The government’s actions are an easy solution to a bigger problem”</strong>, said Imtiaz Ahmad, director of the Centre for Genocide Studies at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh in relation to the communication restrictions and challenges of security and repatriation. Bangladesh had previously banned the sale of SIM cards in the camps. It also began fencing some of the camps and saying it will install watchtowers and surveillance cameras. It also announced that it would begin relocating some refugees to the Silt Island in the Bay of Bengal, despite that being prone to very harsh weather. It has also cut off internet connectivity in the camps. It also removed the local officials working in the camps who were sympathetic towards the refugees. Further, not been allowed to work in Bangladesh, the stateless Rohingya refugees are desperate and are only permitted to work as part-time volunteers. Therefore, besides financial impacts, these policies have increased the vulnerability and insecurities of Rohingyas.<br>Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch’s Asia director, said in a statement that Bangladesh faced a challenge in dealing with the refugee crisis but “made matters worse by imposing restrictions on refugee communications and freedom of movement”. Despite knowing the fact that the refugees are not ready to go anytime soon, the government has failed to make any long-term, multi-layered policy to handle the situation on humanitarian grounds. The government has also not been able to seriously take up the repatriation of refugees with Myanmar. Hence, the current approach of the Bangladesh government is only adding to the humanitarian crisis already being faced by the refugees (emphasis supplied).</p>



<h4>United Nations’ Stand</h4>



<p>In December 2019, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution condemning human rights abuses against Muslim Rohingyas and other minorities in Myanmar. It called on Myanmar to stop the incitement of hatred against Rohingya and other minorities. It further called upon Myanmar to protect all groups and to ensure justice for all violations of human rights, while highlighting the findings of an independent international mission “of gross human rights violations and abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities” by Myanmar’s security forces, which the mission described as “gravest crimes under international law”.<br>However, the problem With such resolutions is that these are not legally binding upon the state against which they are passed but merely reflect the world opinion.<br>Further, there was a case brought against Myanmar by the Gambia for the human rights violations in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and very recently, in January 2020, ICJ ordered Myanmar to prevent genocidal violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority and preserve any evidence of past crimes. These orders are binding on Myanmar.</p>



<h4>Why Does this Crisis Matter?</h4>



<p>The humanitarian crisis that unfolded as a result of the violence that erupted in Myanmar’s Rakhine state is one of the biggest of its nature in the world. As stated by UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, “…Rohingya people have always been one, if not the only, of the most discriminated people in the world, without any recognition of the basic rights…” There have been allegations of, amongst other things, torture, rapes, arbitrary detentions, destruction of property against the Myanmar government. Besides, there have been well planned, institutionalised, and systematic actions by Myanmar security forces to eradicate the existence of the whole Rohingya community. They are being denied their identity, they are forced to leave their homeland and scatter in different parts of the world.</p>



<p><strong>Therefore, a crisis of this nature and scale becomes important for various reasons.</strong><br>Firstly, <strong>“human rights”</strong> is a very sensitive topic in the world right now. It is the touchstonetouch stone of every action of every government and its agencies. Much stress has been given to the protection and respect for human rights under very international documents. Despite that, human rights violations on such a large scale necessitate looking into what actually is being done at the international level for upholding the values of human life, human dignity, human liberty, and human security; and what needs to be further done to put an end to this crisis.<br>Secondly, this crisis poses a <strong>threat to the peace and security</strong> of the entire world. This has two aspects. One, being exposed to such a crisis has a Huge tendency to radicalize young refugee men and <strong>convert them into terrorists</strong>, suicide bombers, etc. and two, it <strong>creates a sense of insecurity and vulnerability</strong> in the minds of all the minority communities around the world. It makes them feel that the majority can do anything with impunity, and there is no one to protect them and their rights. This will create a hostile environment in the world with people, especially minority communities, losing their faith in international law. Therefore, it becomes extremely important to deal with this crisis on a speedy and stringent basis.<br>Thirdly, such a crisis such crisis also <strong>leads to internal disturbances </strong>in the host countries. Countries like Bangladesh, which already have a lot of domestic issues to deal with, are posed with an additional burden to accommodate and care for the refugees. Such a crisis such crisis damages the social, environmental, political, economic, and cultural atmosphere of the host country. Problems like ecological degradation, sanitation problems, malnutrition, the spread of diseases, increased crime rate, trafficking, etc. are all inevitable products of such products such a crisis. Therefore, in this context also it is essential to understand the crisis in every aspect and address it in the best possible way, in order to reduce its impact on the refugees as well the host countries.<br>Lastly, there are some additional concerns with regard to this conflict, such as a <strong>very negative impact </strong>on the children, women, and other vulnerable groups such as the old. In the world that preaches liberty, this crisis has restricted them to their uninhabitable refugee camps without having the freedom to live a dignified and progressive life.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>Therefore, this crisis is a situation of extreme urgency, which demands a swift and collective effort from all international stakeholders in the interest of millions of displaced people and in the larger part of world peace.</p>
