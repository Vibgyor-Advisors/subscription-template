<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“A revolution is not a bed of roses. A revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>                                                 ~Fidel Castro</em></strong></p>



<h3><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>On a December day in 2010, <strong>Mohamed Bouazizi</strong>, a Tunisian street vendor, stood in front of a Government office and set himself on fire, killing himself. Bouazizi had been harassed by cops who attempted to shut down his business with no recourse, and his suicide by self-immolation galvanized Tunisian protesters. His actions helped spark a revolutionary uprising that has come to be known as the <strong>‘Arab Spring’</strong>. Protesters demonstrated against Government corruption and Tunisia’s autocratic president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. A month later, after 23 years in power, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This raised hopes among millions of other citizens within the neighboring Arab countries. Thus, within a short period, the protests spread to other countries like Algeria, Libya, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Yemen, and some other Gulf countries. The demands of the protesters varied from country to country but in general, it included demands for political freedom, social freedom, press freedom, improved human rights conditions, economic betterment, etc. The demands reflect a desire among the masses, particularly the new generation of young and educated, to be liberated from the reins of the old and authoritarian leadership and play a role in the decision-making process of the state. So far, the protests have overthrown four long-serving dictators — <strong>Ben Ali</strong> of <strong>Tunisia</strong>, <strong>Hosni Mubarak </strong>of <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Muammar Gaddafi</strong> of <strong>Libya</strong>, and <strong>Ali Abdullah Saleh</strong> of <strong>Yemen</strong>. While the Bashar Al Assad regime in Syria is struggling for its survival, other countries have successfully managed to suppress the protests against the regimes either by a crackdown or by promising economic and political reforms.</p>



<h4><strong>Why the name ‘Arab Spring’?</strong></h4>



<p>The name “Arab Spring” is a reference to the 1848 Revolution- also known as the “People’s spring” – when political upheavals swept Europe. Ever since the word “spring” has been used to describe movements towards democracy like Czechoslovakia’s 1968 “Prague Spring”. Western media started popularizing the term “Arab Spring” in 2011.</p>



<h4><strong>Who was Mohamed Bouazizi?</strong></h4>



<p>Mohamed Bouazizi was a Tunisian street vendor from the village of Sidi Salah. Bouazizi was three years old when his father died. In the village in his small room, he was educated with his six siblings. To provide basic needs and necessities to his family he left education in his early teens but always dreamt of completing high school. He was the sole earner of the family besides supporting his mother, uncle, younger siblings. He applied for the military but was rejected.</p>



<p>In December 2010, Bouazizi (who was now 26 years old) was getting ready to sell fruits and vegetables. He was stopped by police for not having the necessary permit to sell products. He was humiliated by Faida Hamdy, a female police officer who allegedly slapped him, confiscated his weighing scales, and pushed over his cart. He requested the return of scales to the Governor but was however rejected. Governor even refused to see him despite his threats that he would burn himself.</p>



<p>After his request was turned away, he marched to a Government building and set himself on fire. Before setting himself on fire, he shouted “how do you expect me to make a living”. Although people tried to save him, he was having 90% burn injuries on his body. The President of Tunisia came to see him in the hospital and promised that he will send him to France for treatment but no such transfer was arranged. After remaining 18 days in a comatose state he died in January 2011. Thousands attended his funeral and pledged to avenge his death.</p>



<h4><strong>Aftermath of Bouazizi’s Death</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Tunisia</strong></li></ul>



<p>After the self-immolation of Bouazizi, the Tunisians took to the streets and began demonstrating which was captured by cell phone cameras and shared on the internet. Western Media started popularizing it as ‘Arab Spring’. Within days, protests started popping up across the country, calling upon President Ben Ali and his regime to step down. A brutal security crackdown followed, reported in shocking details by online social media. When protests reached the capital, Tunis, the government responded with even more brutality, arresting demonstrators, activists, and shutting down the Internet. This act marked the end of one of the Arab world&#8217;s most repressive regimes. It was a victory for people power and perhaps the first time ever in history that an Arab dictator has been removed by a revolution instead of a coup d’état.</p>



<p>About a month later, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. A democratic free election was held to choose members of the council in which all the Tunisians participated. The members were given the task of drafting a new constitution and the democratically chosen Prime Minister and President took oath and office.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8g0IXXbkox_QyLQ8cHql5WPZ7lv_8QLwiv4FaAfs8pBz5vP6S_yfWL3guUmBkgMqccZJzS8D62LbVG3pd0LEVt_Ut1rXMH3v19s33nAQMeasBSKKzVCOc72_keI6jEREixPWaA" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\tunis.PNG"/></figure>



<p>Tunisians protest outside the gates of the French Embassy in Tunis. Arab Spring began in Tunisia when a fruit vendor set himself on fire in protest in front of a government building.</p>



<p>After Tunisia protests began to spread to other countries like Libya, Yemen, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Egypt</strong></li></ul>



<p>In late January of the same year (i.e. 2011), massive protests broke out in Egypt only after a few days of the ouster of Ben Ali’s in Tunisia. To control protests the Egyptian government started cracking down violently against the demonstrators. After several days of massive demonstrations and clashes between the security forces and protesters in Cairo and around the country, a turning point came when the Egyptian army announced that it would not use force against the protesters and started calling for the removal of President Hosni Mubarak. After military withdrawal support, the president left office after nearly 30 years, and the senior military officers ceded to the power.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DgRzF6lAmcV57j3ZFvKGi8icuQOdQr_e8EFMSfnhlniGe9hEOB-XIEVwIS2yuWDamnP-IDs3obkzImbOMo78omodcsg0OzlZEGlFBRJJ377YAzKAbKXvu0moHWSRKbvj2K7k4g" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\hosni mubarak.PNG"/></figure>

<p>A great role played by the military in ending the Mubarak regime has led the new military administration to enjoy high public approval. However, the new administration appeared hesitant to transfer full powers to an elected government and the use of force was resumed by military and security forces against the protesters. In late November 2011 despite this multiday outbreak of violence, the parliamentary elections were held and after a year People’s Assembly- a newly elected assembly held its inaugural session.</p>

<p>After the rapid successes in protest movements in Tunisia and Egypt, the protest movements took hold in Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, and Syria.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Syria</strong></li></ul>



<p>In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, the civil war began that lasted for several years, forcing many to leave Syria to seek refuge in Turkey, Greece, and throughout Western Europe. For a time, the militant group ISIS had declared a caliphate (a nation that is governed by Islamic Law) in northern Syria. This group has executed thousands of people there, and many others fled the region in fear of their lives.</p>



<p>Although the ISIS group has largely been defeated in Syria, yet the oppressive regime of long term dictator Bashar al Assad remains in power in the country. The infrastructure of the country has suffered significant damage, and the conflict has devolved into tribal warfare.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Libya</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Libya, Muammar Gaddafi (authoritarian dictator Colonel) was overthrown in 2011, during a violent civil war. He was tortured (literally dragged through the streets) and was executed by opposition fighters. However, since his downfall, Libya has remained in a state of civil war, and the two opposing governments rule separate regions of the country. During the years of political upheaval, the civilian population has suffered significantly, with violence in the streets and access to food, resources, and healthcare services severely limited.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t6_HaoK98y9E-lO5RpHtmrxRC-JyfpofNEHhpM1l5N8C0zFrCbANZmPFnjWtmwpLP9-1-hndD2a8WPR_6_TMa2BT1m7dBXmJJfZ94rXhSpvim6WUx6k4G8ZuAyYO06_EKAMbdg" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\libya.PNG"/></figure>



<p><em>A rebel firing a gun in the heavily contested city of Ajdābiyā in eastern Libya, 2011. The graffiti on the side of the truck reads, “Army of Libya.”</em></p>



<p>This has contributed to the ongoing worldwide refugee crisis, which has seen thousands of Libyan fleeing the country, most often by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, with hopes of new opportunities in Europe.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Bahrain</strong></li></ul>



<p>The reforms in Tunisia and Egypt prompted the other countries to rise against the dictatorship, corruption, and other issues. In February 2011, Bahrain Human Rights activists and members of Bahrain marginalized Shiite majority protested and demanded political and economic reforms in Bahrain. The Bahrain security forces along with forces from Saudi Arabia and UAE violently suppressed the protestors. Dozens of accused protest leaders were imprisoned; hundreds of Shiite workers fired and Shiite mosques in dozens were demolished by the government&#8217;s aftermath protest. An independent investigation commissioned by the Bahraini government concluded that excessive force and torture has been used against the protesters by the government. The government assured us to act on the report in which recommendations for reformation were included.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Yemen</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Yemen, the first protest appeared in late January of 2011. President Ali Abd Allah Salih’s base of support was damaged when a number of the country’s most powerful tribal and military leaders aligned together with the pro-democracy protesters calling for him to step down. But they failed to remove Salih from power. In June, he was injured in a bomb attack and he left Yemen to receive medical treatment, raising hopes among the opposition that a transition would begin. Four months later when Salih returned to the country added to the uncertainty and confusion about Yemen’s political future. He signed an internationally mediated agreement in November of the same year in which he agreed for a phased transfer of power to the then-Vice President, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Accordingly, Hadi took over governing responsibility and formally assumed the Presidency after standing as the sole candidate in a presidential election in 2012.</p>

<h4><strong>Social Media and Revolutions</strong></h4>



<p>Social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and mobile telephones played a major role in spreading information and serving as a mobilizing tool for the spontaneous and organic gathering of protesters during the Arab Spring across the MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) region in early 2011. Images of Tunisian protests against social and economic inequities and the regime’s oppression of people, which were widely shared on social media and through mobile telephone devices, inspired and created anti-government protesters in other countries in the region. Authoritarian regimes have often cut off access to the Internet to quell the protests; though they have failed to stop them.</p>



<p>Tweets, texts, videos, blogs, and Facebook pages became the most effective communication and mobilizing tools for young Arab demonstrators. Social media was key to shaping the political debate of the Arab Spring. Political discussions and calls for change happened not only inside Arab states but also across borders of the MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) region. Social media conversations of protesters in Tunisia and Egypt were continued in other countries. And thanks to the Internet, social media, and mobile phones, images, and conversations of protests quickly reached the world, erasing global information borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although digital technology has been a powerful tool for political and social mobilization, this tumultuous and chaotic decade in the Arab world showed that no real change will happen if repressive regimes are more bent on killing their citizens than making any compromise. If before 2011 the authoritarian governments in MENA have not fully understood how to use social media, by the end of the decade they have skillfully weaponized digital media to spread misinformation and propaganda to maintain control and smear and discredit dissidents, shut down the Internet when it suits them, and intimidate and jail online activists in hopes to curb dissent. Social media became a double-edged sword for forces seeking positive change and maintaining the status quo.</p>



<h4><strong>Impacts of Arab Spring</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Climate Change</strong></li></ul>



<p>MENA is one of the most vulnerable regions of the world to climate change. Shortages of freshwater, drought, desertification, extreme heat and dust storms have already shown the region’s climate trajectory during this decade. Climate change was a contributing factor to the Arab Spring. Crop failures, food shortages, and higher food prices worsened the living conditions of the masses, forcing many of them to move within and beyond the borders of their countries in pursuit of a better life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a study published in the Global Environmental Change journal, there was a strong connection between climate change and conflicts in MENA between 2010 and 2012. For example, severe droughts in Syria between 2006 and 2011 decimated agriculture and caused a major migration of farmers to cities. Competition over scarce resources worsened the living conditions of Syrians, who began demanding change from their government.</p>



<p>Subsequent protests against corruption, poverty, and the authoritarian rule of President Bashar al-Assad started one of the most brutal civil wars of the 21st century, which continues to this day. Over these years, power shortages under extreme heat have triggered mass unrest in Iraq and Egypt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instability and conflict in MENA will be closely tied to climate change in the coming years. German research organization, the Max Planck Institute, predicts that daytime temperatures may reach and stay at 50 degrees Celsius throughout each year in MENA by the end of the century. According to its findings, large areas of MENA may become unlivable by then, if global emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mass Migration</strong></li></ul>



<p>The most prominent feature of the past decade was the start of an enormous global refugee crisis. By the end of the decade, there were more refugees than after the end of World War II. The Syrian war created some of the worst refugees’ crisis in the world. Almost 6 million Syrians fled their country since 2011, and more than 6 million remain internally displaced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The largest number of refugees in Europe have come from Syria. However, despite the spike in the number of asylum seekers in Europe, the biggest burden of helping refugees has fallen in developing countries with weak economies and fragile social stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan received the highest numbers of refugees from Syria in proportion to their populations. Besides, Lebanon and Jordan host more than 2 million Palestinian refugees. Refugees continue to put stress on the social and economic stability of these three countries. More developed and rich Arabian Gulf countries could do more to help refugees in and from MENA than they have done so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sectarian Divisions</strong></li></ul>



<p>One of the most defining events in MENA this decade was the deepening Sunni-Shia schism, intensified by ideological competition between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. During this period, Saudi Arabia, which sees itself as the leader of Sunni Muslims, has stepped up its efforts to contain the growing influence of Iran in MENA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The competition between these two countries over spheres of influence has exacerbated regional hostilities. Saudi Arabia and Iran turned the civil conflicts in Syria and Yemen into protracted bloody proxy wars with no end in sight. Iran’s disproportionate influence on Iraq and the powerful Shiite militia group Hezbollah in Lebanon has also inflamed internal tensions in these countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/qatar-blockade-gulf-crisis-190604220901644.html">cut diplomatic and commercial ties</a>&nbsp;with Qatar in 2017 and imposed a complete blockade on it for its alleged close ties with Iran and for “support of terrorism.” The blockade is still in place. Partly because of these events, Qatar withdrew from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2019, after a sixty-year membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being the world’s major exporters of oil and gas and members of OPEC, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also clashed over the direction of OPEC’s energy policy. Iran often opposed Saudi Arabia-dominated OPEC oil prices and the decision to coordinate prices with non-OPEC countries, such as Russia, which now commands a major influence on the oil cartel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia and Iran continue their bitter regional rivalry through proxy wars, exchange accusations about attacks on strategic objects – such as oil tankers and oil facilities, and supply arms to various militia groups in the region, they have avoided having a direct confrontation so far. With no signs of abating, the Saudi-Iranian cold war is likely to exacerbate the sectarian divisions in MENA for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The Arab Spring protests started in the Middle East because of the repression of people and their rights, the insistence of regimes on a monopoly of power and refusal of regimes to accept the transition power principle through elections, as well as poverty, corruption, unemployment, and marginalization of ethnic and youth groups. Arab dictatorships disgraced their own people and their arrogance went far enough. They used to pass reign by inheritance to their sons. They exploited the resources of the countries and shared it between their family members, friends, and relatives while the common people left in underdevelopment and poverty.</p>



<p>The power of peaceful protests and mass demonstrations through uprisings and the ability of social media had fuelled the protests and communicated its goals to the world. The uproar, turmoil, and tumult of the Arab Spring have shown the rest of the world that millions of people in Islamic nations believe in democratic government and free expression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben Ali ruled Tunisia for 20 years, Mubarak reigned in Egypt for 30 years, and Gaddafi held Libya in a tight grip for 40 years. Yet their bravest challengers were 20-30 years old without ideological baggage, violent intentions, or clear leadership. The groups that initiated and sustained protests had few meaningful experiences with public deliberation or voting and little experience with successful protests. However, these young activists were politically disciplined, pragmatic, and collaborative.</p>



<p>The revolution that started in Tunisia spread strongly to five countries. Now against the government, the citizens have the freedom to speak without any reprisal and democratic elections are taking place. The protests, demonstrations, uprisings try to put an end to the repression of free speech, and economic mismanagement, human rights abuses, and corruption.</p>



<p>The Dictators in Yemen, Libya, and Syria launched a war against their own people. No one can predict what will happen as the war is still on in Syria but one thing is clear that the people have come out in massive protest and have broken the barrier of fear. The protestors started peaceful protests however rulers confronted it by massive and excessive force and violence. Libya, Yemen, and Egypt have proven that it will not be an easy task to say where these revolutions are heading.</p>



<p>The revolutions of the Arab Spring are inspiring revolutions worldwide. The failure of the West system and the double standard policy of the West have encouraged the Arabs to adopt the modern pragmatic Islamic approach and discourage the adoption of western values. The game of the west replacing the dictators of the past with the new ones will not survive for long. And finally the masses, the young generation have promised and learned lessons and they will not give up until they achieve their all the basic and human rights.</p>



<p>This has brought the region a novel contour – a wave of protests for democratic reforms in an otherwise authoritarian Arab world. The regime change also carries with it the potentials of change in policies towards the neighborhood and beyond. Throughout the uprisings, the major regional countries have fought political and diplomatic wars among themselves aiming to assert their influence over the region. The outside powers have taken the opportunity to strengthen their interests by intervening in the conflicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the prospect of democracy within the region has receded. Most regimes have been able to keep at bay, at least for the time being, the calls for change. The expectations of the movement turned out to be overambitious. Arab spring is now commonly referred to as Arab winter (reflecting the failure of protest movements to bring about change within the region). Democracy may not have come fully to these countries as expected, yet the region has nevertheless changed dramatically in the last three years. The regimes have survived, but there is no surety of how long they will survive. The internal and external environment has changed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with an area of 2.3m sq/km, is a giant of sub-Saharan Africa, bordered by nine other countries. DRC was formerly referred to as Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-Leopoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire. It is the 2nd largest country in the African Continent after Algeria and the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa with Kinshasa it&#8217;s Capital. It has been divided into 26 provinces.<br>The country has enormous mineral wealth – copper, diamond, gold, cobalt, etc., and potentially large reserves of oil and natural gas. Paradoxically, this resource-rich country is also the site of one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The conflicts of 1996 and 1998 have resulted in massive disruption of the social, political, and economic fabric of the country. For over a decade the country has been mired in conflict with devastating effects on its civilian population. Though the parties involved within the conflict have their perspective regarding the cause and course of the conflict, nobody can deny that the region is in dire need of peace as well as sustainable development to break the ‘conflict trap’ that has brought miseries for all the conflict-ridden countries of the world including the ones in the African continent.<br>The costs of the conflict are self-evident. Besides death and destruction, large-scale displacement is an integral part of the conflict. Other humanitarian costs include a negative impact on women and other vulnerable groups, and there has been a noticeable increase in post-trauma stress syndrome and the resultant psychiatric problems for the victims. The economic costs of the conflict cannot be confined to a particular sector of industry or investment prospects. It has affected the important sources of livelihood of the local people.</p>



<h4><strong>Colonization and Independence</strong></h4>



<p>The colonization in DRC started in 1870 by King Leopold II of Belgium with the exploitation of natural resources, forced labor, mass killings, and widespread slave labor through his harsh rule for almost 90 years. The country witnessed brutal colonization following a hue and cry internationally. In 1908, the Belgian parliament took over the Free State from Leopold following international pressure, and then it became the Belgian Congo, under the rule of the elected Belgian government.<br>Patrice Lumumba was elected the First Prime Minister of the DRC in May 1960. But after a few months, the PM was overthrown by a military group led by Joseph Desire Mobutu with the help from the US and Belgium and was later assassinated in 1961<br>Joseph Mobutu after overthrowing the PM Lumumba started a dictatorship for almost 36 years, and during this period he renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko and renamed the country Zaire and the country was known as Zaire from 1971 to 1997.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin of Crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo</strong></h4>



<p><strong>• The Mobutu Era and First Congo Conflict</strong></p>



<p>During the tenure of Joseph Mobutu, a one-party system was established wherein elections were held periodically, with the incumbent head of the state as the only candidate. Mobutu was guilty of severe human rights violations and political repression. Corruption was integral to the system, and politicians became entirely dependent on Mobutu’s goodwill. He consolidated power by co-opting potential rivals and exploited the country’s vast natural resources. By the 1990s, the country’s economy was near collapse due to mismanagement, corruption, and authoritarianism. This overall dismal scenario and the later happenings in the DRC gave credibility to the stance that conflicts in Africa, including the one in the DRC, are due to ‘bad governance’.</p>



<p>Bad governance within the state accompanied by the external dimension, i.e. the Rwandan genocide of 1994 laid the foundation of conflict in the DRC. Some of the militias responsible for killing thousands of Tutsis in Rwanda fled across the border to the DRC. This provoked Rwanda and Uganda to invade the Congo and finally, they invaded the DRC in July 1996.<br>The Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo (AFDL) under the leadership of Laurent Kabila and backed by Rwanda and Uganda ousted Mobutu in May 1997. The ascendancy of Kabila led to the end of the first conflict, and the name of the country was restored to the DRC.</p>



<p>• <strong>Kabila Regime and the Second Congo Conflict</strong></p>



<p>Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of the exploitation of resources and with the help of many countries, overthrew Rwanda and Uganda out of DRC. The Lusaka ceasefire agreement (July 1999) and deployment of the UN peacekeeping force in 2000 attempted to end the hostilities between nations. However, the violence continued in DRC from 1998 to 2003. Rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda fought Government forces supported by Angola Namibia attacked back resulting in the second Congo war. In addition to this, there was also a proxy war which continued till 2008 between Rwanda and Uganda.</p>



<h4><strong>Peace and Democratic Attempts</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>Consequences of the Crisis</strong>:</h4>



<p><strong>• Killings and Displacement</strong></p>



<p>The people of the DRC have suffered immensely throughout colonial times and in the post-independence era. The continuation of an exploitative colonial legacy by the leaders of the independent DRC brought a trail of death, destruction, and underdevelopment for the people. The ongoing conflicts have aggravated the situation. It has claimed numerous lives and plunged the resource-rich country into chaos and acute underdevelopment.</p>

<p>The United Nations in 2005 described the crisis in Eastern Congo, as the ‘world’s worst humanitarian crisis.’ Since 2000, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has documented the humanitarian impact of conflict through mortality surveys. The first four studies, conducted by IRC, estimated that 3.9 million people had died since 1998. About 10 percent of all the deaths were due to violence and 90 percent were due to diseases like malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition. The fifth survey concluded that 5.4 million deaths have occurred between 1998 and 2007, with as many as 45,000 people dying every month. As with previous IRC studies in the DRC, the majority of deaths have been due to infectious diseases, malnutrition, and maternity-related problems. In 2007, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs put the figures of internally displaced persons at 1.16 million. The UNHCR put the figures for Congolese refugees in the neighboring countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda at 310,000. A Human Rights Watch report has accused DRC‘s neighboring countries of committing abuses both economically as well as physically.</p>

<h4><strong>Impact of Crisis on Women and Children</strong></h4>



<p>The most vulnerable to the Congo crisis are women and children. Displacement increases women’s risk of sexual violence. Many children lose access to education. While the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) works to integrate all displaced children within the DRC into a national education system, many of the schools still lack the resources necessary to effectively support the staff and students. UNHRC is on the ground providing life-saving humanitarian support to millions of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees in the DRC.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Word\women.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r1XZZxvUrGfo8-A2wu86wj6Q9QvK_Cz0ZW0YytKvIwyWFnGUgmGj6vvcdjrt22PDMYUiljuIzshehkiKGsVdN2S7BXb-9nv5JFdC-p-ByDaLQkQGjWVC9QJ7hNA6ge-HQvy9Cg" width="488" height="277"></p>



<p><em>A displaced Congolese woman carries her belongings as she enters a United Nations base in Monigi, 5 Km from Goma in 2012.</em></p>



<p>According to Jeanie Bandu Bahati (coordinator of an organization that promoted development, gender, and peace) held that there is a catastrophic and chaotic situation in DRC with women and girls confronted by permanent displacement, massacres, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, house burning, etc.<br>According to a report by the International Rescue Committee, since the end of the 1st war in DRC in 1998, at least 5.4 million people have died. Due to hunger, diseases, violence, and displacement every month 45000 Congolese die (half of them are children).<br>Eastern Congo is the world’s worst place for women. Rape in Congo exists on a scale seen nowhere in the world is used as a weapon of war. Rape as a weapon of war had destroyed women, families, and communities.<br>The United Nations peace-keeping forces have been accused of adding to the woes of the people. According to a 2007 report of the Human Rights Watch from December 2004 to August 2006, around 140 allegations of sexual exploitation involving United Nations personnel were recorded in Congo.</p>



<p>• <strong>Economic Implications</strong></p>



<p>The conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue and increased external debt. Foreign business houses have curtailed operations due to an uncertain atmosphere, lack of infrastructure, and a non-conducive and difficult work environment. There has been an increase in unemployment. A country rich in natural resources has become one of the least developed countries. The infrastructure in terms of road density, electrification, and water supply remains poor. The country is the world’s largest producer of cobalt and a major producer of copper and diamond but the resources of the country have been a curse and brought misfortunes for the natives and all the benefits have gone to the outsiders. Resources have been used to fuel conflict and not to get people out of poverty. In 2007, the Human Development Index ranked the country at 168 positions out of a total of 177 countries.</p>



<p>The unstable situation has provided a fertile ground for the stakeholders to exploit the natural wealth of DRC with impunity. A United Nations report published in April 2001 pointed out that all the parties involved in the conflict profited by looting resources of DRC. The overall situation hence remains fragile and poverty is all-pervasive.<br>The DRC is emerging from a decade of political instability and violent conflict that has led to the near-collapse of the economy and caused the annual per capita income to plummet to $120 in 2005 (down from $380 in 1985). Experts have described this as ‘development in reverse.’ The country has the second-largest swath of rainforests in the world. With 86 million hectares of the area covered by rainforests, the DRC accounts for over half of the total remaining rainforests in the Central Africa region. Congo forests are a vital resource, both for the Congolese people and the global environment. About 40 million Congolese depend on the forests for their food, income, energy, shelter, medicines, and cultural needs. Described as the ‘second lung’ of the planet for their ability to store carbon dioxide on a global scale, these Congolese forests too have been threatened by widespread poverty and instability in the region.</p>



<h4><strong>International Response</strong></h4>



<p>The UN and various International communities have been greatly involved in seeking a resolution to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) conflict, specifically in the past decade.</p>



<p><strong>• Human Rights Council (HRC)</strong></p>



<p>In the HRC Report 2012, the HRC referenced Resolution 19/27, which was adopted in March 2012. The resolution encouraged the establishment of a national Human Rights Commission in the DRC and asked the High Commissioner of Human Rights to submit a report in 2013.</p>



<p><strong>I. United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)</strong></p>



<p>In October 2010, the OHCHR released a report on the DRC entitled “DRC: Mapping Human Rights Violations 1993-2003”. The report notes the serious incidents of Human Rights abuses. OHCHR also addressed the issue of sexual violence in its 2011 report entitled “Remedies and Reparations for Victims of Sexual Violence in DRC”. The report highlighted how victims of sexual violence are often responsible for bearing the cost of harm done to them and asked the Congolese Government to implement a reparations fund for victims of sexual violence.</p>



<p><strong>• International Criminal Court (ICC)</strong></p>



<p>In 2004, the then-president of DRC (Kabila) referred his country to the ICC and the former ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo formally announced his decision to open the first-ever ICC investigation into the crimes committed in the DRC.<br>In 2012, former Leader of the Union Des Patriotes Congolais (UPC), Thomas Lubanga, was convicted of war crimes and child soldiers and was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in jail.</p>



<p>• United Nations Security Council (UNSCThe most crucial element of the UNSC’s intervention in the DRC has been its authorization of two missions to the country. First is the United Nations Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) that was established in 1999 following the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. MONUC was succeeded in 2010 by United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO), aimed to better protect civilians and address issues that were raised during the MONUC period, including the sexual abuse by United Nations Peacekeepers.</p>



<h4><strong>Regional Response</strong></h4>



<p><strong>I. Southern African Development Community (SADC</strong>)</p>



<p>In 2008, the members of SADC (heads of state) agreed to immediately deploy a team of military experts to assess the escalating violence in the country, as well as an additional team to evaluate the situation on the ground.</p>



<p>• <strong>International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the February 2013 Framework Agreement</strong></p>



<p>Congolese President Kabila used the ICGLR as a platform for discussion by convening a series of meetings. The Peace Agreement that was signed in 2013 by Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the DRC, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia was negotiated by UNSC with ICGLR. The Agreement emphasized issues of sexual violence and displacement, among other Human Rights abuses, and noted that progress begins with the cessation of violence.<br>At the country level, the DRC agreed to work towards decentralization and further structural form. Regional players promised to respect not only one another’s sovereignty but to also increase cooperation between states.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The political situation in the DRC is bad. The extreme violence in the country is from the very beginning but the violence in the country exacerbated due to the failure of holding the presidential election constitutionally. The governance problems have an immediate impact on the humanitarian situation. Ultimately, the spirit of democracy not guns must rule the DRC, and improvements in governance should be the primary focus of all the local, regional as well as international actors in their efforts to help the long-suffering people. To avoid the return of the conflict the reconstruction process has to accompany initiatives to control violence. The DRC needs global assistance to make a speedy economic recovery and to ensure that the fruits of the development are distributed equitably. There is an urgent need to address the disparities among different communities that inhabit the country and promote democracy and the rule of law, which can combat corruption and promote good governance. Without an integrated approach that involves national and international institutions, the return to chaos is imminent as shallow peace may not be sustainable. The continued and genuine efforts by local, national, and international actors that work in tandem can be the only way out for the country to experience genuine democracy and prevent a return to chaos.</p>



<p>The Government of DRC to create a conducive climate for dialogue must ensure that human rights and rule of law will be respected and the justice system will be ceased as a political tool. The political prisoners at the first instance should be released and the persons subjected to harsh violence to be rehabilitated.<br>The persons who have been forced to flee to different areas must be provided with humanitarian assistance and ways must be carved out to end this conflict which is in DRC for years now. The humanitarian condition of women in the country can be described as degrading and chaotic. The condition of women folk has worsened in the last two decades. There needs a revision of protection, security, socio-economic and political factors to uplift the condition of women and children in DRC.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>South Sudan, officially referred to as the Republic of South Sudan is a landlocked country in East-Central Africa. It got independence in 2011 from the Republic of Sudan, emerging as becoming the world’s newest country. After almost nine years of gaining independence, South Sudan should be a country full of hope and new possibilities, but instead, it is in the grip of a massive humanitarian crisis.</p>



<p>Political conflict, ecological imbalance compounded by economic woes and drought, has caused massive displacement, raging violence, and dire food shortage. The ongoing conflict and insecurity have pushed millions to the brink of starvation for years. In 2017, famine or near-famine conditions were reported in some countries, and South Sudan was one among them. In February 2017, famine was declared in South Sudan and has remained a persistent threat ever since.</p>



<h4><strong>When did the Hunger Crisis Start in South Sudan?</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan gained independence in 2011 from the Republic of Sudan. In 2005, a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), also known as the Naivasha Agreement, was signed between the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the Government of Sudan. This agreement ended more than two decades of war between rebels in South Sudan and the Government in Khartoum. Amidst the signing of the CPA and independence, South Sudan made important progress in state-building. National and State governments were formed along with the institutions that were necessary to ensure the rule of law.<br><strong>According to the World Bank, they made certain social and economic progress like:</strong></p>



<p>• The number of children enrolled in primary school increased six-fold between 2005 to 2012 from 300,000 to 1.8 million.<br>• Infant mortality decreased by 25%.<br>• The number of skilled midwives grew.<br>• Polio was eradicated.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this celebration was short-lived. The ruling political party (Sudan People’s Liberation Movement) that originally led the way for independence is now divided and fighting for power. After two years of its independence, it plunged into conflict. In December 2013, this political infighting erupted into violence in the streets of Juba, the capital of South Sudan, after South Sudan’s current President Salva Kiir accused its vice president Riek Machar of an attempted coup and the fight started between two factions of the Government. Violence spread like wildfire in South Sudan, displacing thousands of civilians who rushed to seek refuge in U.N bases. and This fight is continuing to date, becoming an increasingly brutal civil war, and affecting the entire country.</p>



<p>In 2015 after peace negotiations, both parties signed an Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS). Unfortunately, this agreement did not end the violence instead, which has spread across the entire country, now splintered along ethnic, political, and regional lines. The conflict has affected nearly everyone and raised deep economic and social problems in the country.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="226" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\graph.PNG" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lpAg2_sWFsXdsroUGwSknO0Xc0O71adIYZgdHwGFlc1BFM-pjxqD7okbo8O7dmeau3nMZ6mnO2h6cL0wB9YriIdtuta_IPLEUFvr7JcN2CMNYrjUk_MYcISlyYYa-mj7L0BEIQ"></p>



<p>The ongoing conflict and insecurity have pushed millions to the brink of starvation for years. In 2017, famine was declared there. The famine crisis had taken a toll on the South Sudanese people making it difficult to access the required necessities of life like food, healthcare. Has destroyed everything in South Sudan like crops, health centers, and other required necessities of life. People there are without food and the economy has collapsed. Women and children are most vulnerable to the effects of food insecurity, malnutrition, and conflict.</p>



<p>Famine was declared officially in 2017 when people have already begun to starve to death. It is the diplomatic equivalent of a seven-alarm fire. Food shortage and famine in South Sudan are not sudden occurrences like the earthquake in Haiti and flooding in Indonesia but are rather a result of the prolonged and slow process of combined factors. Famine in the region is not caused by climate changes but it is the result of deeper structural and geopolitical anomalies. The maxim is true that famine does not result purely from natural causes but is “man-made”. Such a description, however, avoids any real accountability for those that have caused the crisis. South Sudan famine would be more accurately described as the “government made”. The most immediate cause lies within the tactics employed by the South Sudan government and its principal Rebel opponent in fighting the war.</p>



<p>Government and Rebel forces attack civilian areas much more than they attack each other. They target means of survival of civilian populations deemed to be unsupportive. The government has also concentrated attacks on sites where agricultural production traditionally fed large parts of South Sudan, not only leading to massive human displacement but also devastating local grain production which leads to hyperinflation in food prices.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\graph 3.PNG" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6387em3bns9BWM4CFsrg6M0aQhYxEtIA8uo-ZCbQ7nYhb3SNEA359D3YTzk5b56kbQEFH-aLDsCBs08qMWruiZVw6kFqr5uz4zRQthLwqRsAwxE63uUu8WeS6kWv0_VvxEb_Qw" width="383" height="263"></p>



<h4>What’s Happening in South Sudan Now?</h4>



<p>A handful of peace agreements between the current President Salva Kiir and the former rebel leader Riek Machar have been signed over the course of the war – the most recent in 2018 –but the treaty have been repeatedly violated. While reported incidents of conflict have decreased somewhat since the new deal, the situation in South Sudan remains highly unstable and outbreaks of violence continue to occur. Relatively small numbers of people have started to return home in light of the tenuous peace agreement, but new displacement remains high. Those affected are struggling to survive after years of a protracted conflict that has destroyed livelihoods, forced people to leave their homes, disrupted planting, and eliminated critical coping resources, like savings and livestock.</p>



<p>Many humanitarian organizations, including Mercy Corps, are working with the UN, using both private contributions and funding from the international community, to address the urgent needs of people in South Sudan.</p>



<h4>Effects of Conflict</h4>



<p>One of the worst hunger crises of the past 25 years was the famine in East Africa in 2011/2012.<br>Following a power crisis that erupted in 2013, South Sudan has spiraled into a conflict, which has spread across most parts of the country and resulting in the death of tens of thousands of people. The ongoing conflict that has engulfed the country of South Sudan results in high food prices, economic disruption, and low agricultural production. Due to these reasons, the UN and the Government of South Sudan were forced to declare famine in 2017.</p>



<p>Famines are an acute food crisis, usually after drought or due to armed conflict. Famine is the worst form of food shortage. In addition to old people, babies and small children are especially threatened by starvation. According to the United Nations definition (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), there is a famine if at least: 20% of households suffer from extreme food shortages, 30% of the population is acutely malnourished; and 2 out of every 10,000 people, or 4 children, die daily from food shortages.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Word\graph 2.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/t9AkesIVk6cSriU6DVH9fB0JX-7z_F7VYzH0CXHoetp9PIv6N9k6G_oBtEuOYWaKoR-ifSwCFA8XY3ciTaT5kf6v6HcrGd16UKVbDbzKEcZL4tRAEqQElL_mIHXhKGdqBVdF8Q" width="423" height="250"></p>



<p><em>Food insecurity in South Sudan as of September 2018</em>.</p>



<p>Hunger anywhere can have long-term, debilitating consequences, but it can be particularly threatening during a complex crisis just like the one in South Sudan. When people go hungry, they have trouble staying healthy and become more susceptible to dangerous diseases. Their bodies are not as strong or productive as they could be, which makes it difficult for them to work, find food, and keep their families safe at a time when they urgently need the strength to do so.</p>



<p>Children’s development is also seriously impacted by hunger. Without proper nutrition, they don’t hit critical developmental milestones, which may permanently inhibit their ability to reach their full potential find out and function for the rest of their lives. Hungry children don’t learn as well, and they are also at a higher risk of disease.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="339" height="207" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\child.PNG" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lkMlY2lqUhlSRYDiey5xxydZgKd_rKA-eIPNPi5pBD2319pMA8S__TR-Nb1lx7Vt2B5UfZgsmRGvtKNAMyNrE6wZH_mM1Waa6VWaflQIkUjhPuYh9FetcV8TxfLtg8xR1L8OBQ"></p>



<p><em>Nyaguande, 4, lives with her family in a displacement site since fleeing attacks at their home. More than half the populations of loopholes uprooted South Sudanese people are children.<br></em>According to <strong>United Nation Agencies</strong>, this conflict has pushed South Sudanese into hunger. Nearly 60% of the population (6.1 million people) has been pushed into extreme hunger. Children, there are at imminent risk of death from malnutrition. Children who survive malnutrition in early childhood face lifelong damage to their health and their physical and cognitive development. Even short bouts of hunger and malnutrition carry long-term cognizance.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Jeremy Hopkins</strong>, the South Sudan representative for the UN Children’s Agency, more than 2,00,000 children were at risk of death from malnutrition in the country.</p>



<p><strong>The World Food Programme reported</strong> that 67% of the South Sudanese population (4.9 million people) needed food urgently, and at least 100,000, according to the UN, were in imminent danger of death by starvation.</p>



<p>According to the <strong>Action Against Hunger report</strong>, conflict pushed more people into hunger in 2018, and malnutrition rates remained high. Two million people were initially displaced, and 2.3 million people have become refugees. The country is marked by excessive gender-based violence, declining economic opportunities, and strained health centers. Half of the children are not attending schools, and two-thirds of the population has no access to safe water.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\cap.PNG" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/h_ea2m44qFEvzhjrNVsWgpo7m7WBJBw8PaEqOzvRDIKS8G1t7YCSItdBwUVq3lkmWdCZcCa2DDJIfgTkXvTeMheQyiy8dcM7DPr0tC9F3NqBDrztCzAzHcYnFd27yo6unmfVMw" width="425" height="232"></p>



<p><em>South Sudanese children fleeing from recent fighting in Lasu, Central Equatoria, stand in church after crossing the border into the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br></em>According to the <strong>United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization</strong>, many families have exhausted every means they have for survival. The people were predominantly farmers and war has disrupted agriculture. They have lost their livestock, even their farming tools.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Mercy Corps</strong>,<strong> more than 3 million </strong>people had been displaced by ongoing violence across the country, forcing families to abandon agricultural land and livestock to survive with few food resources. Over 4 million people &#8211; 1 in 3 – have been forced to flee their homes due to this brutal war. Nearly 2.5 million have fled to neighboring countries. There are now 1 million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, making up about half of the country’s total refugee population.</p>



<p>There were significant challenges for agencies delivering food in famine-affected areas. Civilians reported that the food they received was taken by soldiers involved in the fighting.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\pic.PNG" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y6fv8aP4OWjTSd0YG-xziVgFa6za5_pWy4aGGKd3d-P1LneILWVMF0d2LO6MFqEEGsLlcLBBg6yRnEH-5KyRqxK3MSkQonCeY-whVbdvCK6Tco-bNsJBKtUAGhyjl7yX2mZhUQ" width="443" height="278"></p>

<h4><strong>Economic and Human costs of conflict</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan has very fertile soil and significant oil deposits. Its economy is dependent on exporting oil. Oil is near all that South Sudan exports. It generates about 60% of the country’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product). In 2016, South Sudan&#8217;s oil-dependent economy faced multiple major shocks including the eruption of conflict in the capital city Juba, disruptions in agricultural production, and a significant drop in international oil prices. The poor performance of the economy triggered several economic crises, the cost of necessities, particularly food skyrocketed. The price of staple foods, such as Sorghum, maize, and beans, are at record highs.</p>



<p>The human cost of the conflict is enormous. The World Bank estimates that poverty had risen significantly from 44.7% in 2011 to 66% in 2016. Poverty is so deeper than in the period before the conflict. According to the World Bank, there is significant gender disparity, indicating few educational opportunities for the generation of women. Male literacy is 40%, while the female literacy rate is only 16%. Other indicators of poverty include high infant mortality rate and high maternal mortality rate.</p>



<h4><strong>Who is Most Affected by this crisis?</strong></h4>



<p>Women and children are disproportionately impacted by the conflict in South Sudan. The majority of the population of the United Nations displacement sites is made up of women and children, with more than 60% of South Sudanese refugees being under age 18.</p>



<p>Additionally, sexual violence towards women and girls is pervasive. The United Nations recently reported a surge in sexual attacks, including women and girls experiencing abuse during raids on their homes. The people committing these crimes are rarely held responsible.</p>



<p>To make the situation even more difficult, women and girls continue to bear the burden of family caretaking even during crises crisis. In the face of increased violence, recurring displacement, and loss of livelihoods, daily tasks like collecting water and firewood make them continual targets for attack.</p>



<h4><strong>How is the Hunger Crisis being Tackled in South Sudan?</strong></h4>



<p>It is widely acknowledged that the South Sudan food emergency is man-made. Human actions, particularly the proliferation of Armed factions and military groups continue to make humanitarian response extremely difficult and restrict access to markets, farms, and medical services. However, there are national as well as international organizations that are working to mitigate the impact of the hunger crisis on the lives of south sudanase. Some of the organizations which are working in tackling the hunger crisis in South Sudan are:</p>



<p><strong>• United Nation Agencies</strong></p>



<p>The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (FAO), the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and World Food Programme (WFP) called for sustainable peace across the country, and unhindered, safe access to all areas where people who survived the fighting but are left without nothing are in, and need of life-saving assistance. According to Mahimbo Mdoe, UNICEF’s Representative in South Sudan, more than 80% of children treated recover, which makes it even more urgent to access those who have suffered the most as a result of the fighting. UNICEF and partners have admitted 147421 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition into various outpatient treatment programs (OTP) and stabilization centers since January 2018. So far, FAO supported 1.4 million farmers with agricultural seeds and tools during the main planting season so that they can increase cereal production. During the planting season, FAO distributes over 4,800 tons of crop seeds. WFP provides life-saving emergency food supplies, food in return for work to construct and rehabilitate community assets, food for school meals, and special products for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in children, and pregnant and nursing women. So far in 2018, WFP has reached 3.1 million people with 30,000 tons of food.</p>



<p><strong>• Non-Governmental Organization</strong></p>



<p>Oxfam has a strong and established team working tirelessly from 10 bases across the country, providing essential services and helping to keep people alive. According to them, they are working in South Sudan to deliver timely and effective humanitarian aid to help people affected by the conflict. It is currently supporting over 5,00,000 people with humanitarian assistance, including clean water, hygiene facilities, food, fuel, and income support.</p>



<p><strong>• Government Initiatives in tackling the crisis</strong></p>



<p>The Government of South Sudan is particularly concerned about hunger among South Sudanese school-aged children, many of whom rely heavily on free meals provided in schools. School meals for students in South Sudan are mainly provided by WFP, the same U.N. agency sounding the alarm over the potential famine. But WFP is only able to reach close to half a million students, against a total of 3 million to 3.5 million students.<br>In 2018, WFP and South Sudan’s government (Ministry of Education) launched a five-year strategy that aims to shift the current school meal set-up from relying solely on imported food to increase production for locally grown food. To increasingly using produce grown by local communities. The government is looking at external support to plug in additional resources and aims to increase its allocation for school meals.<br>In 2018, a Peace Agreement, R-ARCSS (Revitalization Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan) was signed between the current President Salva Kiir and the former rebel leader Riek Machar. As a result, Machar rejoined the Government and resumed his Vice President&#8217;s duties. This deal certainly offers a promising end to South Sudan’s conflict.<br>President Kiir also signed a declaration (Khartoum Declaration of Agreement) with the leaders of Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), giving amnesty to the troops, army generals, and leaders of SPLM. The amnesty included Vice President Machar which also and was an important gesture showing Kiir’s commitment to moving on from the senseless war.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan, the world’s youngest country has the world’s highest rates of population growth and maternal mortality, and less than 30% of the population is literate. The country has abundant natural resources, but less than 200 miles of paved roads.</p>



<p>The Peace Agreement 2015 which was viewed as a milestone towards ending the conflict unfortunately did not prove to be successful enough. the violence continued in South Sudan instead of this agreement. The conflict which began with a political dispute will not be resolved by simply reconciling rival political leaders. The manipulation and atrocities committed by combatants against civilians are likely to have long-term effects.</p>



<p>The world must do everything it can do to treat the symptoms of this emergency but much attention is to be paid to address the root cause of the crisis. The situation in South Sudan is desperate and urgent. The fact that the crisis is man-made means that it is within human power to end it. Currently, millions of lives can be saved which are on the verge of starvation. But the window opportunity is very limited. Humanitarian aid alone cannot end the conflict, nor can it fully respond to the devastating impacts of conflict on individuals, their livelihood, and national economies that have been lingering for decades. But taking a sustainable approach by investing in integrating development efforts such as social protection and social safety can reduce the risk of recurrence of a lethal upcoming crisis. The new approach must prioritize safeguarding livelihoods and institutions as well as saving lives.</p>



<p>The country’s most immediate need is to end the brutal and senseless conflict that has displaced more than one-third of the population so that people can return to their homes and resume farming to prevent additional periods of near-famine conditions. South Sudan’s refugees should receive the same support and attention as refugees from elsewhere. Refugees are an international responsibility; which has to be shared. The refugee protection regime is enhanced through dedicated international cooperation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility-sharing among all states.</p>
