<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><strong>&#8220;<em>Healthcare is not a privilege, it is a right. It is a right as fundamental as civil rights. It&#8217;s right as fundamental as giving every child a chance to get a public education. &#8220;</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;~Rod Blagojevich</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields. Physicians and physician associates are part of these health professionals. Dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.</p>



<p><strong>Types of Healthcare:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Primary care</li><li>Secondary care</li><li>Tertiary care</li></ol>



<h4><strong>1. Primary Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>Primary care includes the first place patients go for medical care. It refers to the work of health professionals who act as the first point of consultation for all patients within the health care system.</p>



<p>Primary care team members include:</p>



<ul><li>Primary care doctors also called general practice, general internists, or family doctors</li><li>Pediatricians (doctors for babies and children)</li><li>Nurses</li><li>Physician assistants</li><li>Nurse practitioners</li></ul>



<h4><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Secondary Healthcare&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Secondary care includes acute care: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury, or other health condition. This care is often found in a hospital emergency department. Secondary care also includes skilled attendance during childbirth, intensive care, and medical imaging services.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;secondary care&#8221; is sometimes used synonymously with &#8220;hospital care&#8221;. However, many secondary care providers, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, most dental specialties or physiotherapists, do not necessarily work in hospitals.</p>



<h4><strong>3.  Tertiary Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>This type of healthcare is known as specialized consultative healthcare usually for inpatients and on referral from primary and secondary healthcare for advanced medical investigation and treatment. The following examples of tertiary care services are plastic surgery, burn treatment, cardiac surgery, cancer management, neurosurgery, complex medical and surgical interventions, etc.</p>



<h4>Health System</h4>



<p>A <strong>health system</strong> is an organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to meet the health needs of target populations.</p>



<h4><strong>Key Components of a Well Functioning Health System</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>As per WHO a well functioning health system responds in a balanced way to a population’s needs and expectations by:&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Improving the health status of individuals, families and communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Defending the population against what threatens its health.</p>



<p>• Protecting people against the financial consequences of ill-health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Providing equitable access to people-centered care.</p>



<p>• Making it possible for people to participate in decisions affecting their health and health system.</p>



<p>Thus it also includes the healthcare facilities being affordable to people despite their financial conditions.</p>



<h4><strong>What Does Affordability Mean?</strong></h4>



<p>Although the “affordability” of healthcare is a common concern, the term is rarely defined. Affordability is fundamentally a function of income, spending, and judgments about the value of goods and services for their price. Affordability is mostly taken as an economic concept.</p>



<p>Much of today’s health care focus centers on the rising costs of healthcare. Today’s challenging economic situation has redirected much of the health care discussion to affordability, not simply health care costs.</p>



<p>As a generic term, affordability can best be defined as a measure of someone’s ability to purchase a good or service. It describes whether a person or organization is able to make a purchase without unacceptable or unreasonable sacrifices, with limited sources.&nbsp;Similarly, taking simple definition <strong>Healthcare Affordability </strong>generally describes whether a person or organization has sufficient income to pay for or provide for health care costs. These costs could be insurance premiums or direct health care service costs.</p>



<p>Health care would be affordable if all the classes of society are able to pay for the delivery of the service or when the states spend a high economy on the health systems and provide it at low costs or free of costs or through insurance and fundings.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Basis for Affordable Healthcare</h4>



<h4>1.   <strong>Right to Health</strong></h4>



<p>The right to health is the economic, social, and cultural right to a universal minimum standard of health to which all individuals are entitled. The concept of a right to health has been enumerated in international agreements which include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>



<ul><li>The Constitution of <strong>WHO </strong>defines the right to health as &#8220;the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health,&#8221; and enumerates some principles of this right as healthy child development; equitable dissemination of medical knowledge and its benefits; and government-provided social measures to ensure adequate health.</li><li>Article 25 of the United Nations&#8217; 1948 <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> states that &#8220;Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care and necessary social services.&#8221;&nbsp;</li><li>Understanding health as a human right creates a legal obligation on states to ensure access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality as well as to providing for the underlying determinants of health, such as safe and potable water, sanitation, food, housing, health-related information and education, and gender equality.</li><li>A States’ obligation to support the right to health – including through the allocation of “maximum available resources” to progressively realize this goal &#8211; is reviewed through various international human rights mechanisms, such as the Universal Periodic Review, or the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In many cases, the right to health has been adopted into domestic law or Constitutional law.</li><li>A rights-based approach to health requires that health policy and programs must prioritize the needs of those furthest behind first towards greater equity, a principle that has been echoed in the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Health Coverage.</li><li>The right to health must be enjoyed without discrimination on the grounds of race, age, ethnicity, or any other status. Non-discrimination and equality requires states to take steps to redress any discriminatory law, practice, or policy</li><li>Another feature of rights-based approaches is meaningful participation. Participation means ensuring that national stakeholders – including non-state actors such as non-governmental organizations – are meaningfully involved in all phases of programming: assessment, analysis, planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>2.   Core Components of the Right to Health</strong></h4>



<p>The right to health (Article 12) as defined in General Comment 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – a committee of Independent Experts, responsible for overseeing adherence to the Covenant. (4) The right includes the following core components:</p>



<ul><li>Availability&nbsp;</li><li>Accessibility&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Accessibility has four overlapping dimensions:</p>



<ul><li>non-discrimination</li><li>physical accessibility</li><li>economical accessibility (affordability)</li><li>information accessibility.</li><li>Acceptability&nbsp;</li><li>Quality</li></ul>



<h4>Why is Affordable Healthcare Needed?</h4>



<p>Affordable healthcare is needed because most of the population of the world is either poor or fall below the poverty line. Health conditions and complications do not affect only the rich and economically stable. These can befall anyone and every person whether poor or rich should get all the proper treatment and care required. For that reason, it is necessary that healthcare should be affordable to every irrespective of economical status.</p>



<p>Many health treatments like cardiosurgeries, neurosurgeries, diabetes treatment are costly and thus people who are economically weak are unable to afford these treatments which are necessary for their survival. Thus it is important that medical care should be affordable to all classes of society without financial hindrance.</p>



<p>The states need to spend more on healthcare systems to make it affordable for all.</p>



<p><strong>Healthcare can be affordable in two ways:</strong></p>



<ul><li>When the cost of delivery of medical care is low.</li><li>When people are able to pay for the treatments which can be easy when the government would finance healthcare particularly for the poor.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Universal Health Coverage</strong></h4>



<p>There should be a universal health coverage. According to WHO Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It includes the full range of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.</p>



<p>Currently, at least half of the people in the world do not receive the health services they need. About 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year because of out-of-pocket spending on health. This must change.</p>



<p>To make health for all a reality, we need individuals and communities who have access to high-quality health services so that they take care of their own health and the health of their families; skilled health workers providing quality, people-centered care; and policy-makers committed to investing in universal health coverage.</p>



<p>Universal health coverage should be based on strong, people-centered primary health care. Good health systems are rooted in the communities they serve. They focus not only on preventing and treating disease and illness but also on helping to improve well-being and quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>Asia/Pacific Health Coverage : An analysis of 2018 report :&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Health Status</strong></li></ul>



<p>Between 2000 and 2015, the average maternal mortality rate across lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries was cut by more than half, but it is still high at 140 deaths per 100 000 live births.</p>



<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in Asia-Pacific. In 2016, there were 10.4 million newly occurring (incident) TB cases worldwide, 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative people globally. One-third of new cases and one-fourth of deaths were estimated in India and Indonesia alone.</p>



<p>The share of deaths due to non-communicable diseases is increasing in Asia-Pacific. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers were the most common causes of death, being responsible for over 82% and 78% of all deaths, on average, across high and upper-middle-income Asia-Pacific countries.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Healthcare Resources</strong></li></ul>



<p>The supply of doctors is one per 1000&nbsp; across lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries and 1.2 per 1000 population – is reported in upper-middle-income countries.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The number of nurses is highest in high-income countries such as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, with over ten nurses per 1000 population. The supply is much lower in a number of low-income countries, including Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, where there are 0.5 nurses or less per 1000 population.</p>



<p>The number of hospital beds per capita is 2.8 and 1.8 per 1000 population on average across upper-middle and lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries respectively, lower than high-income Asia-Pacific countries average of 5.3, but it varies considerably.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Healthcare Spending</strong></li></ul>



<p>Lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries spend just below USD 200 per person per year on health, against USD 670 and USD 3 450 in upper-middle-income and high-income Asia-Pacific countries respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This amounts to over 4.3% of gross domestic product, on average, in middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries, compared to over 7.3% in high-income Asia-Pacific countries in 2015.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, high-income countries reported an increase of 0.8 percentage points from 2010-2015, twice the increase reported by middle and low-income countries at 0.4 percentage points.</p>



<p>The share of public spending in total health spending increased in all Asia-Pacific countries from 2010 to 2015, but it is much lower in lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries compared to upper-middle and high-income Asia-Pacific countries: 41.9% compared to 62% and 72.3%, respectively<strong>.</strong> Although there is some improvement in Asia-Pacific countries in the last years but yet not up to the mark. Countries in the Asia/Pacific region need to step up their efforts to give more people access to affordable, quality health care, suggests the 2018 report.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Management </strong>O<strong>f Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of policies and plans adopted by the government, private sector business, and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, pharmaceuticals, health human resources, and public health.</p>



<p>Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health are also important subfields.</p>



<p>Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of aging, and health inequities, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a vaccination policy, supporting public health programs in providing vaccinations to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.</p>



<p>The rapid emergence of many chronic diseases, which require costly long-term care and treatment, is making many health managers and policymakers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is HIV/AIDS. Another major public health concern is diabetes. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of tobacco smoking, linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.</p>



<p>Antibiotic resistance is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as tuberculosis. The World Health Organization, for its World Health Day 2011 campaign, is calling for an intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines for future generations.</p>



<h4><strong>Steps to Make Healthcare Affordable:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<ol><li><strong>Increase Spending on Healthcare:&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>There is not enough investment in the field of healthcare. Investment in public health departments needs to be made as most of these institutions are inefficient in providing services due to which people have to turn to private institutions. Early detection of diseases by providing better services through these public healthcare facilities can help in the efficient treatment and save subsequent expenditure.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Invest in Innovation and Technology:</strong></p>



<p>Innovation can help in driving down costs and offer improvements in the quality of healthcare. Certain measures like procuring, testing, and distributing generic medicines to public hospitals at low costs should be implemented.</p>



<p> 3.<strong> Subsidies and Benefits:</strong></p>



<p>Organizations that manufacture low-cost devices can be attracted to set up hubs by providing subsidies and developing hassle-free policies for ease of business. This will help the weaker sections to afford the proper healthcare e.g the biggest players in the medical diagnostic device field namely, Philips, GE, and Siemens manufacture low-cost devices in India.</p>



<p> 4.<strong> </strong>Health insurance policies help the individual by making <strong>medical expenditures affordable</strong>.&nbsp; Such policies should be supported by the government of all countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p> 5<strong>.</strong> <strong>Medical Loan:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Medical Loan is another step that will make healthcare accessible whenever the need is felt. The government should make medical loans easily available and accessible to all. Such loans should be simple, without any documentary and other formalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong> </strong>6.<strong> </strong>The healthcare system of a country should be affordable to all particularly to low and moderate-income families. It should be <strong>sustainably </strong>and<strong> justly financed.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong> </strong>7<strong>. Build the National Digital Infrastructure:</strong> </p>



<p>Governments must invest in the necessary telecommunications infrastructure that underlies an eHealth strategy.</p>



<p> 8. <strong>Invest in Human Capital:</strong></p>



<p>Governments and the private sector should share a mutual interest in and responsibility for training medical personnel and civil servants in technology capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p> 9. <strong>Develop a Regulatory and Legal Framework:</strong></p>



<p>Parliament or the national assembly cements a mandate for digitizing healthcare in national legislation, protecting patients, and enabling innovation.</p>



<p><strong> 10.</strong> <strong>Appoint an eHealth Government Agency:</strong></p>



<p>A centralized agency is best positioned to coordinate national eHealth projects across ministries; across the district, provincial, and federal levels of government; and with patient associations, medical associations, and businesses.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Health care is one of the most essential topics in the world today. Providing affordable and accessible healthcare to one and all are very important and various steps have been taken and policies framed in this direction. But, there is a need for better planning and execution to make healthcare facilities affordable for the large population through better policy decisions.</p>



<p>Affordability need not merely be met with finance capital or the ability to pay, it needs to be also viewed through the lens of the ability to seek services which make sense and appeal to the masses and the classes. When health care is more affordable, more people have access to health care.</p>



<p>That’s why health plans are laser-focused on making health care more affordable by changing the way that we pay for products and services and promoting reforms that provide more value for consumers and employers.</p>



<p>States should follow policies that create pricing transparency, ensure a competitive marketplace, promote value-based payment, and provide flexibility for health plans to offer products that meet the needs of our customers.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The doctrine of humanitarian intervention is one of the most contested issues in the world today. It is both widely accepted and yet still highly controversial.</p>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention poses significant challenges and raises a number of questions that give rise to an ongoing debate in regard to the current international legal framework.</p>



<p>The article considers whether humanitarian intervention is legal under international law. This is a common question but produces an undecided answer: humanitarian intervention appears to contradict the United Nations Charter, but developments in state practice since 1945might have made it legal under certain circumstances.</p>



<p>Some scholars see it as a legal right for states in some situations, whereas others argue that in all situations humanitarian intervention is an illegal act.</p>



<p>The debate suggests that humanitarian intervention is either legal or illegal depending on one’s understanding of how international law is constructed, changed, and represented.</p>



<h4><strong>Definition</strong></h4>



<p>It is difficult to construe a unifying definition of humanitarian intervention. Humanitarian intervention has been defined differently by different scholars.</p>



<p>For example, humanitarian intervention has been defined by Wil Verwey as:</p>



<p>“The threat or use of force by a state or states abroad, for the sole purpose of preventing or putting a halt to a serious violation of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to life of persons, regardless of their nationality, such protection taking place neither upon authorization by relevant organs of the United Nation no with permission by the legitimate government of the target state.”</p>



<p><strong>T.D Gill defines humanitarian intervention</strong> as, &#8220;The humanitarian intervention is the military activity by one or more States – irrespective of whether they are part of a military alliance or regional organization – aimed at putting an end to or protecting persons, not of its(their) nationality who are subjected to serious violations of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to life, without the consent of the target State and without any form of authorization by the UN Security Council&#8221;.</p>



<h4><strong>Characteristics of Humanitarian Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>Some of the essential characteristics of humanitarian intervention are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>A humanitarian intervention involves the threat and use of military forces as a central feature.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>It is an intervention in the sense that it entails interfering in the internal affairs of a state by sending military forces into the territory or airspace of a sovereign state that has not committed an act of aggression against another state.</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li>The intervention is in response to situations that do not necessarily pose direct threats to states&#8217; strategic interests but instead are motivated by humanitarian objectives.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>



<p>Getting involved in the affairs of another state on humanitarian grounds has been a subject of discussion in public international law since the 19th century.</p>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention was born out of predominantly three humanitarian catastrophes during the Nineties, namely Rwanda, Srebrenica, and Kosovo. In each of these instances, the UN was notably absent from taking action, which led to either a humanitarian crisis occurring or another body having to take action out with the law to prevent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The first catastrophe that led to the call for humanitarian intervention was the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. In the space of approximately 100 days, over half a million Tutsis were killed by the Hutu government and a further two million sought refuge in neighboring countries. This happened despite the presence of a UN peacekeeping mission, UNAMIR(United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda)on the ground. The UNAMIR, however, did not have a robust mandate and thus was not authorized to use force by the UNSC so it could do very little to prevent the attacks, especially when their numbers were actually reduced over this period.</p>



<p>Shortly after the genocide in Rwanda came a massacre of Bosnian Muslim males in Srebrenica in 1995. Because of greater fighting in the former Yugoslavia the UN created safe areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995 and the UN Protection Force was given the task of defending them. However, after Serb forces attacked the safe areas, the peacekeeping force was unable to do anything to stop it, as again UNSC had not authorized them to use force. This resulted in the killing of approximately 7,000 Muslim men. This situation, along with that of Rwanda, highlighted the real need for the international community to step up and help people in these situations, particularly if the UNSC is unable or refuses to act.</p>



<p>This is why in the case of Kosovo in 1999, the world saw a different outcome. When the UNSC refused to take any action to combat the persecution of Kosovar Albanians from the FRY(Yugoslavian army)due to continued opposition from Russia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) stepped in and began a series of aerial strikes in the name of humanitarian intervention. This action by NATO was illegal under international law as the organization did not have UNSC authorization to use force charter and it could not be classed as self-defense as a NATO member state had not been attacked. However, it was widely agreed that the intervention was ‘illegal but legitimate’ due to the humanitarian purposes it was trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Use of force</strong></h4>



<p>International law is fundamentally concerned with regulating war between states, and well-developed bodies of law exist on state conduct in war and the decision to use force.</p>



<p>In order to understand the legal basis of humanitarian intervention, it is very important to know the laws related to the use of force by states under the UN Charter. It takes two contributions that are elementary to today’s legal regime on war: it outlaws the use of force on part of individual states, and it empowers the Security Council to make all decisions on collective measures that involve military force.</p>



<ol><li>Article 2(4) establishes the first element and it requires that states not use or threaten force against other states: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This is a general prohibition, set in the section of the Charter that defines the common and fundamental obligations of UN members and of the organization itself, and it is often cited as the primary contribution of the UN system to international order. It goes along with Article2 (3), which insists that UN members settle their interstate disputes by “peaceful means.</li><li>Articles 24,39 and 42 deliver the power to use force to the Security Council. These sections of the Charter establish that the Council has the “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security” (Article 24 ) and that it can take all measures it deems necessary in that pursuit, including military action against states or other threats (Article 42 ).</li></ol>



<p>Therefore, having all these articles in the background we may conclude that the use of force is not allowed unless all other peaceful resources have been taken by states and if such recourse fails then only use of force is permitted. In other words, whether the use of force is permitted or not will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Legal basis and justification of Humanitarian intervention</strong></h4>



<p>The advocates of intervention put forward two types of arguments.&nbsp;Firstly, humanitarian intervention is directed neither at the territorial integrity nor the political independence of the targeted State and is not thus inconsistent with Art. 2(4).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the Charter is not an instrument protecting only a single value, that is peace at all costs, but it has in fact several purposes to which it gives expression. No doubt one of its fundamental values is the prohibition of the use of force, but it cannot be ignored that another is the protection of fundamental human rights. Thus, in cases of grave conflict between the maintenance of peace and respect for human rights, the proponents hold that sovereignty and non-recourse to force have to yield to humanitarian imperatives. In other words, there is a duty, at least in the most extreme cases, to strike a balance between “conflict-minimization and the protection of human rights.” Finally, a practical argument which has emotional and moral overtones and is thus, more compelling: <em>must the international community stand idly by while millions of human beings are being massacred just because in the SC a permanent member holds its protective hand over the culprit?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>UN Charter&#8217;s prohibition of use of force is not absolute </strong></h4>



<p>The use of force is only prohibited under Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter when it goes against “territorial integrity and political independence”.<sup> </sup>As a “genuine humanitarian intervention does not result in territorial conquest or political subjugation. It is a distortion to argue that [it] is prohibited by Art. 2(4).” The reference in Art. 2(4) to the “Purposes of the UN”, excludes any prohibition on humanitarian intervention as a <em>bona fide</em> humanitarian intervention is consistent with the purposes of the UN.</p>



<p>Furthermore<sup> &nbsp; </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 1(3) of the UN Charter states one of the purposes is “to achieve international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms”. As the humanitarian intervention is not contrary to these purposes, it is arguably still consistent with Art. 2(4).</p>



<p>Humanitarian intervention is permissible where the UN fails to fulfill its task of safeguarding human rights, as surely the drafters of the Charter did not intend states to merely do anything where serious human rights violations are occurring. Genocide Convention (1948) states that parties must “prevent and punish” the “crime of genocide” allows for humanitarian intervention where genocide is being committed. The ICJ opinion in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)—the Genocide Case, was “the obligation of States parties is rather to employ all means reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible”. It can be asserted using Wesley Hohfeld’s jural correlative that given the positive duty upon states to prevent genocide, which was reiterated in the Genocide Convention Case, there must be a correlative right of peoples to be protected, and in the case of genocide where there are no realistic means of exercising this right, the right to intervene must be vested in other states.</p>



<h4><strong>Interpretation of Provisions</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention<sup> </sup>provides that treaty provisions shall be interpreted in light of the treaty’s object and purpose. This is a crucial point often missed by strict constructionists. Art. 31(2) of the Vienna Convention<sup> </sup>then explains that the object and purpose of a treaty are determined, <em>inter alia</em>, by looking at the treaty’s preamble. The preamble of the UN Charter provides that its members reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person.<em> </em>In <em>Nuclear Weapons Case</em>, ICJ Judge Weeramantry noted that “dignity and worth of the human person” are keynote principles of the UN Charter.</p>



<p>Pursuant to the Vienna Convention, the provisions of the UN Charter (including Art. 2(4)’s prohibition on the use of force) must be interpreted in conformity with the purposes of the UN Charter. These purposes specifically include the promotion and protection of human rights. It is important to note that Art. 2(4) speaks of conduct inconsistent with the <em>purposes </em>of the Charter, not necessarily with the provisions of the Charter.</p>



<p>Also, the preamble of the Rome Statute acknowledges that during this century millions of children, women, and men have been victims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity and that such grave crimes threaten the peace, security, and well-being of the world.</p>



<p>Art. 2(4) cannot be interpreted to abrogate the very purposes of the Charter, especially its human rights provisions, or to deprive Articles 1, 55, 56, and the preamble of any meaning. Therefore, the article cannot be construed to prohibit <em>bona fide </em>humanitarian intervention necessary to enforce the principles of the Charter even if force is unauthorized by the SC.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>And the preamble also provides that an additional purpose of the Charter is “to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law<em> </em>can be maintained.”<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<h4><strong>Humanitarian intervention has achieved the status of&nbsp; customary international law </strong></h4>



<p>Customary international law is one component of international law. Customary international law refers to international obligations arising from established international practices, as opposed to obligations arising from formal written conventions and treaties. Customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of states that they follow from a sense of legal obligation.</p>



<p>Customary law is formed each time an international incident occurs, based on the way the international community reacts.<sup> </sup>A resolution put before the SC condemning the NATO bombing in Serbia was defeated by 12 votes to three, implying acceptance of the action as legal.<sup> </sup>This theory of the formation of new customary legal norms may well justify the Kosovo operation by way of hindsight; because nobody did anything to stop it or oppose it, then the law may have embraced it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many other precedents also which give the legal basis of humanitarian intervention and thus paving it&#8217;s way to the status of customary international law for example UK/US no-fly zone imposed over Southern Iraq from 1991 to 2003, US attack against ISIS, UK/US/France airstrikes against Syria&#8217;s chemical weapon facilities in 2018, etc. All these interventions were claimed to be done on a humanitarian basis to prevent crises. Therefore from all the above examples, we may derive that Humanitarian intervention has achieved the status of customary international law.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>The Responsibility To Protect</strong></h4>



<p>The norm of non-intervention must give way when a State commits genocide or crimes against humanity on its own territory. This approach was first reflected in a report by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (‘ICISS’). ICISS was created after the Kosovo intervention under the support of the Canadian government and a group of private foundations in response to appeals by Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, produced a detailed Report<sup> </sup>on humanitarian intervention entitled “The Responsibility to Protect”. The Commission recognized that the responsibility to protect its people from killing and other grave harm was the most basic and fundamental of all the responsibilities that sovereignty imposes—and pursuant to this doctrine if a state cannot or will not protect its people from such harm, then coercive intervention for human protection purposes, including ultimately military intervention, by others in the international community may be justified in extreme cases.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>The Commission then goes on to state the conditions under which the interests of protection prevail. For an intervention to be lawful there must be:</p>



<ol><li>a just cause;</li><li>the right intention (<em>recta intention</em>);&nbsp;</li><li>a situation of last recourse (<em>ultima ratio</em>);&nbsp;</li><li>respect for the principle of proportionality;&nbsp;</li><li>reasonable prospects of success;&nbsp;</li><li>a prior request for authorization by the SC of the action.</li></ol>



<p>For the just cause (a.), it is clearly stated that only a grave and irreparable harm for human beings, i.e. considerable losses of human lives (actual or expected) or ethnic cleansing on a large scale can give rise to a right of military intervention.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>As for the “right intention” (b.), the Commission stresses that the essential aim of the intervention must be to halt or avert human suffering<em>.</em><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Further, the intervention must be the last recourse (c.), i.e. all diplomatic and other non-military means must previously have been explored. It is not necessary for all ways to have been actually tried and proved unsuccessful; it is, however, necessary to establish there were reasonable grounds for believing that, in the circumstances, the measure, if attempted, would not have been successful, e.g., by reason of lack of time.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Moreover, the intervention must be proportionate (d.) in scope, duration, and intensity to the humanitarian aim pursued, which means that the force used must be the minimum necessary to accomplish the aim.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Finally, the criterion of reasonable prospects of success of the operation (e.) requires there must be a reasonable chance of success in halting or averting the suffering which has justified the intervention, with the consequences of action not likely to be worse than the consequences of inaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore whether there was a bonafide humanitarian intervention or not must be checked out under the above references.</p>



<p>Besides as already mentioned, the preamble of the UN Charter also provides that an additional purpose of the Charter is “to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.” The Responsibility to Protect the norm, which is one of those other sources, holds that states have a fundamental duty to protect their people from serious and systematic human rights abuses. The GA, offering strong evidence of opinion Juris, explained, “Each individual state has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity through appropriate and necessary means and, if a state cannot or will not prevent the occurrence of such abuses, then the intervention by other actors in the international community is justified.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention is very important. Although a group of propounders does not consider it legal to intervene in the affairs of other states there is enough legal basis, as explained above to justify humanitarian intervention. How can a part of the world ignore all the atrocities and human killings and violations in some other part of the world, turn its back, and live a luxurious life? It is against the basic moral character of humans to let a population in some people of the world die on their own just because international law is not expressly allowing it.</p>



<p>The need of the hour is that the UN should expressly provide some laws to authorize humanitarian intervention in the parts of the world where it is gravely needed. Until then the world should take recourse to the broad interpretation of the UN Charter and Customary International law to intervene in other states on humanitarian grounds to prevent and protect human atrocities in any part of the world.</p>



<p>But at the same time, it has to be taken care of that any superpower or developed state should not intervene in an underdeveloped State for their own benefits and agendas on the pretext of humanitarian intervention.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Alcohol is a drink that contains the recreational drug ethanol. Alcohol is classified as a ‘sedative hypnotic’ drug, which means it acts to depress the central nervous system at high doses. Alcohol has medicinal value and is used e.g in the treatment of cough, to keep the body warm in winter, etc., however, it has dangerous effects much more than it benefits as a drink. At lower doses, alcohol can act as a stimulant, which may induce feelings of euphoria and talkativeness, however drinking too much alcohol at a time can lead to drowsiness, respiratory depression (where breathing becomes slow, shallow, or stops entirely), coma, or even death.</p>



<p>This writeup will deal with the dangerous effect of alcohol on the body and will try to analyze how alcohol is killing the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What Happens by Intake of Alcohol</strong>?</h4>



<p>After the intake of alcohol, it is rapidly absorbed into the blood (20% through the stomach and 80% through the small intestine). It usually peaks in the blood after 30-90 minutes and is carried through all the organs of the body.</p>



<p>Alcohol may cause following effects on the body:</p>



<ul><li>Blurred and double vision</li><li>Slurred and confused speech</li><li>Loss of minerals and salt through urine</li><li>Clumsiness and difficulty in walking</li><li>Mood changes</li><li>Loss of memory</li><li>Disrupted sleep&nbsp;</li><li>Nausea and vomiting etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KER5tqOxsqmRnkEDY6L7AXoTDVyyQ0QQCwUxVbQSVLLsTqhIbrcg0ukhNDMPgUs4__jlb6_LT_eg0Zj_jtzaMnomfu9FohRsX7ETwA8UYIcnB4GkjY_iRJr2iBZhceY5E-3zRQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Alcohol is a cause of many health conditions and, for almost all conditions, heavier alcohol use means a higher risk of disease or injury. Drinking alcohol regularly over time and in a pattern of heavy single drinking sessions, alcohol can cause a variety of health conditions. These include cancers and other conditions such as liver disease, which can even lead to permanent liver damage due to alcohol.</p>



<h4><strong>Social Impact of Alcohol Consumption</strong></h4>



<ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>Effect of Alcoholism on Family:</strong></li></ul>



<p>Researches have shown that alcohol abuse has led to many adverse effects in the families e. g., it causes domestic violence, causes families&#8217; financial problems, impairs decision-making skills, and plays a role in child neglect and abuse. Spousal violence is more likely, not only when a partner is alcohol dependent or a problem drinker, but also when the partner is an infrequent drinker who occasionally drinks heavily.</p>



<p>The impact of drinking on family life can include substantial mental health problems for other family members, such as anxiety, fear, and depression.</p>



<p>Drinking outside the home can mean less time spent at home. The financial costs of alcohol purchase and medical treatment, as well as lost wages, can leave other family members destitute.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Effect of Alcohol on Children:</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>~</strong>Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of the most common direct consequences of parental alcohol, caused by alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy. Children with FAS display a variety of symptoms, many of which are life-long and permanent.</p>



<p><strong>~</strong>Children who grow up in a home with a loved one dealing with alcohol addiction may be affected as well; they are at significant to develop alcohol use disorders themselves.</p>



<p><strong>~</strong>Growing up in a home where at least one parent has a severe alcohol use disorder can increase a child&#8217;s chances of developing psychological and emotional problems e. g, abuse, depression, mood swings, etc.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Effect of Alcoholism on Work Performance:</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Alcohol consumption can affect work performance in several ways:</p>



<p><strong>Absences</strong> &#8211; There is ample evidence that people with alcohol dependence and drinking problems are on sick leave more frequently than other employees, with a significant cost to employees, employers, and social security systems.</p>



<p><strong>Productivity: </strong>Heavy drinking at work may reduce productivity. Performance at work may be affected both by the volume and pattern of drinking. Heavy drinkers have lower performance, problems in personal relationships, and lack of self-direction.</p>



<p><strong>Work accidents: </strong>In different parts of the world a high number of work accidents have been attributed to alcohol use.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Crime Rate :</strong></li></ul>



<p>Alcohol leads to intoxication, by which a person is not able to distinguish between right and wrong, and thereby there are many chances of a person indulging in criminal activity when he is intoxicated. Because of this, alcohol-related violence and crime rates are on the rise throughout the country.</p>



<p>For example, an estimated 37 percent of sexual assaults and rapes are committed by offenders who were under the influence of alcohol. Similarly, according to research, about 40 percent of convicted murderers had used alcohol before or during the crime, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NXq7HmekkHLKfBwJ11nKxT070euH44-pDn1ufYvZ5HlLIVG9yl1smz9d2VbPoRJlDuztV24ZJBsEnEJ3BzG4TRZUGskOFrbkIeVSh9cYvWlxWbbbtlOeIKVPmOMNcmoxG2Dmjw" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Alcohol consumption contributes to 3 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, the harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 5.1% of the global burden of disease.</p>



<p>According to the Global status report on alcohol and health 2018 released by WHO more than 3 million people died as a result of harmful use of alcohol in 2016. This represents 1 in 20 deaths. More than three-quarters of these deaths were among men. Overall, the harmful use of alcohol causes more than 5% of the global disease burden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all deaths attributable to alcohol, 28% were due to injuries, such as those from traffic crashes, self-harm, and interpersonal violence; 21% due to digestive disorders; 19% due to cardiovascular diseases, and the remainder due to infectious diseases, cancers, mental disorders, and other health conditions.</p>



<p>Globally an estimated 237 million men and 46 million women suffer from alcohol-use disorders with the highest prevalence among men and women in the European region (14.8% and 3.5%) and the Region of Americas (11.5% and 5.1%). Alcohol-use disorders are more common in high-income countries.</p>

<h4><strong>Policies and Strategies</strong></h4>



<p>For long time policies and strategies have been framed with regard to alcohol consumption.</p>



<h4><strong>Global Strategy to Reduce&nbsp; Harmful&nbsp; Use of&nbsp; Alcohol,2010</strong></h4>



<p>The WHO in 2010, provided a global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol which seeks to improve the health and social outcomes for individuals, families, and communities, with considerably reduced morbidity and mortality due to the harmful use of alcohol and their ensuing social consequences. It is envisaged that the global strategy will promote and support local, regional, and global actions to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol.</p>



<p>The global strategy focuses on ten key areas of policy options and interventions at the national level. The ten areas for national action are:</p>



<ol><li>Leadership, awareness, and commitment.</li><li>Health services&#8217; response.</li><li>Community action.</li><li>Drink-driving policies and countermeasures.</li><li>Availability of alcohol.</li><li>Marketing of alcoholic beverages.</li><li>Pricing policies.</li><li>Reducing the negative consequences of drinking and alcohol intoxication.</li><li>Reducing the public health impact of illicit alcohol and informally produced alcohol.</li><li>Monitoring and surveillance.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>Global Alcohol Policy Alliance&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>In 2001 the <strong>Global Alcohol Policy Alliance </strong>was established.</p>



<p>The&nbsp; Global Alcohol Policy Alliance is a developing network of non-government organizations and people working in public health agencies who share information on alcohol issues and advocate evidence-based alcohol policies</p>



<h4><strong>Mission Statement</strong></h4>



<p>The GAPA mission is to reduce alcohol-related harm worldwide by promoting science-based policies independent of commercial interests.</p>



<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Provide a forum for alcohol policy advocates through meetings, information sharing, publications, and electronic communications; with the purpose to disseminate information internationally on effective alcohol policies and policy advocacy;</li><li>Bring to the attention of national governments, international governmental and non-governmental agencies and communities the social, economic, and health consequences of alcohol consumption and related harm; with the purpose to advocate for international and national governmental and non-governmental efforts to reduce alcohol-related harm worldwide;</li><li>Co-operate with national and local organizations and communities to alleviate alcohol-related problems;</li><li>Encourage international research on the social and health impact of the actions of the multinational alcohol beverage industry;</li><li>Monitor and promote research on the impact of international trade agreements on alcohol-related harm;</li><li>Monitor the activities of the alcoholic beverage industry;</li><li>Place priority on research and advocacy regarding those parts of the world where alcohol problems are increasing;</li><li>Ensure that member groups in those areas have the technology and support capacity to participate in a global network for communication and action.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>The Global Alcohol Policy Conference</strong></h4>



<p>The GAPA holds the <strong>Global Alcohol Policy Conference, </strong>which is the leading forum for the world’s alcohol policymakers, advocates, researchers, civil society activists, and practitioners. The 6th Global Alcohol Policy Conference was held in Dublin Ireland in early March, marking the 20th anniversary of the first GAPC.</p>



<h5><strong>GAPA principles for advocacy during the WHO process to accelerate action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol 2020 – 2022</strong></h5>



<p>Following a decision at the World Health Organisation 146th Executive Board WHO will start a two-year process to “accelerate action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol”. This includes a consultation towards an action plan 2022-2030 for the global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol; development of a technical report on the harmful use of alcohol-related to cross-border alcohol marketing; a call for more resources to be made available; and a review of the Global strategy in 2030. Civil society has an important role to play in contributing to consultations and communicating with decision-makers about what such an accelerated action will entail. GAPA and its global network will participate actively in the two-year process and beyond.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Alcohol consumption has increased since past years which is turning fatal for the populations worldwide. Reports already throw light on how many people die because of alcohol consumption. To some people, it may appear like a cool habit to follow and to others an escape from the worries of life which eventually ends up with the addiction. But beyond every worry or habit, what matters is the precious life of a person which is a blessing. Even if life is spared, it causes several serious health issues that interrupt the normal mechanism of life and eats up your economy as well. It also leads to social disorder and leaves long-termed impacts on children or partners who are victims of alcohol violence. Although international policies have been framed, states must follow up with strong domestic control measures.</p>



<p>Even though the prevalence of alcohol use in the world is very high, it has not been brought under legal control contrary to other substances like cocaine, cannabis, etc.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s high time that the governments could treat alcohol as other narcotic drugs and calls for legislation for the control of alcohol uniformly across the world, as a public health policy.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>The use of children as soldiers in armed conflicts is among the most morally repugnant practices in the Children are combatants in nearly three-quarters of the world&#8217;s conflicts. Yet moral reasons aside, compelling strategies are being continuously discussed and planned for limiting the use of child soldiers.ASeveralinternational laws and rules have been framed in this regard.<br>Today, It is against the international legislation that protects the rights of children to use children in welfare nevertheless it still remains a persistent issue in conflict-torn areas of the world. Children are used in direct combat, support roles like cooks and messengers, and as suicide bombers, to name a few duties—as child soldiers.<br>Further, the experts say, when conflicts involving children end, the prospects for a lasting peace are hurt by large populations of psychologically scarred, demobilized child soldiers.An also, countries that are more into recruiting child soldiers risk long-term instability as generations of youth are sucked into the wars.</p>



<h4>Definition: What is meant by a child soldier?</h4>



<p><strong>Child Soldier: </strong>&#8220;A person under the age of 18 recruited either voluntarily or by force to participate in an armed forces group in any capacity&#8221;.<br>A child soldier is not just someone who is involved in the fighting. They can also be those in other roles such as cooks, porters, messengers, human shields, spies, suicide bombers, or those used for sexual exploitation. It includes children recruited and trained for military purposes, but not used in war.<br>A child soldier or a child associated with an armed force group, according to the Paris Principles in 2007, &#8220;is any person, 18 years of age or younger, who is or has been recruited or used by an armed group in any capacity&#8221; (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), 2007).</p>



<h4>Brief History</h4>



<p>Child soldiers is not a new phenomenon and have been a norm throughout history, accepted in almost all societies until relatively recently. History is filled with children who have been trained and used for fighting, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, used as sex slaves, or recruited for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda.<br>The world had seen several such cases In the past, for example, when Napoleon recruited thousands of teenagers in his army, or when thousands of children were forced into different armies during the First and Second World War.<br>Children continued to be used throughout the 20th and early 21st century in every continent, with concentrations in parts of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. It is only in recent times that international efforts have begun to limit and reduce the military use of children.</p>



<h4>Reasons for the Recruitment of Children</h4>



<p>Children are and have been recruited in all parts of the world. They are recruited either by state armed forces(controlled by the government)or by non-state armed groups(armed groups outside government control) which include non-state armed paramilitary organisations, using children, such as militias, insurgents, terrorist organisations, guerrilla movements, ideologically or religiously-driven groups, armed liberation movements, and other types of quasi-military organisation, for different reasons e.g</p>



<p>● Multiple sources/reports claim that children are comparatively easy targets when it comes to radicalisation, manipulation, or intimidation, being one of the reasons why children are recruited as soldiers. Also as children are more obedient than adults and do not have a developed sense of danger, it is easy for recruiters to train and use children in any desired situation.</p>



<p>● In combat, children can be daring and tenacious, particularly when under the influence of drugs—a common practice—or when compelled by political or religious zeal. Child units can greatly add to confusion on battlefields, slowing opposing forces’ progress.</p>



<p>● In addition to this, children do not require many resources to maintain and thus are easily manageable.<br>Many times children choose by themselves to become child soldiers.<br>Giving away one&#8217;s childhood and becoming a soldier at that age is not a happy choice, a child would make. There are several reasons why children choose this path for themselves and become soldiers:</p>



<p>● Children who join voluntarily often do not have a full understanding of the consequences of joining, or of the severity and danger of their tasks. Reasons children freely choose to join militant groups may be many, e.g., their families identify with a side of The conflict, and they feel they are honoring their families and their countries by choosing to fight; a survival tactic where militant groups promise safety and a sense of family; they are pledged to some type of pay off, or they have a sense of vengeance for lived inequalities that they feel war can correct.</p>



<p>● In many cases, children choose to join as a result of economic or social pressures. Being poor, displaced, separated from their families, or living in a combat zone can make children particularly vulnerable to being recruited.</p>



<h4>Roles of Child Soldiers</h4>



<p>Child soldiers can take on a number of roles in armed conflicts and are recruited as young as the age of 8, any of them will be used in direct combat, as early as the age of 10, because modern assault rifles are easily managed by small children making child soldiers as useful and deadly in combat as adult soldiers. According to Singer, besides combat, typical roles for child soldiers are patrolling and surveillance, scouting or spying, and prisoner guard. These traditional soldier roles are often taken on by boys more often than girls. Not surprisingly, given what we know about human and sex trafficking worldwide, girls who are recruited into armed conflict are more often used as sex slaves or taken as wives or mistresses by army leaders. Other roles may be to act as cooks, porters, messengers, suicide bombers, etc.</p>



<h4>Global Estimate and the Current Situation:</h4>



<p>● According to the report of Child Soldiers International, 201, the number of children involved in armed conflicts has risen 159% since 2012, with almost 30,000 verified cases of recruitment in 17 countries around the globe.T he involvement of girls in armed conflict has more than quadrupled between 2017 and 2018, growing from 216 to 893 reported cases</p>



<p>● The reports also state that fifty countries still allow children to be recruited into armed forces and that children under the age of 18 were seven being recruited and trained for military purposes in 46 countries; of these, most recruit from age 17, fewer than 20 recruits from age 16, and an unknown, smaller number, recruit younger children. States that still rely on children to staff their armed forces include the world&#8217;s three most populous countries (China, India, and the United States) and the most economically powerful (all G7 countries apart from Italy and Japan).</p>



<p>● United Nations in 2017 Identified 14 countries where children were widely used by such groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.</p>



<p>● In 2017, the UN Secretary-General&#8217;s annual &#8220;name and shame&#8221; list highlighted the armed forces of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for recruiting and using under-18s for armed conflict. But non-state armed groups also recruit children in these and other countries. The report said there were at least 4000 verified violations by government forces and over 11,500 by non-state armed groups in the 20 country situations is examined.</p>



<p>● Also, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hired child soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur) to fight against Houthis during the Yemeni Civil War (2015-present).</p>



<h4>Impact on Children</h4>



<p>“The child is recognized, universally, as a human being who must be able to develop physically, mentally, socially, morally, and spiritually, with freedom and dignity.”A child soldier, as against this, does not enjoy any of the mentioned rights or happiness in his life and lives an entirely different life filled with horror, misery, and violence. They are acting as child soldiers affect children physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, and morally as well.<br>The scale of the impact on children was first acknowledged by the international community in a major report commissioned by the UN General Assembly, Impact of Armed Conflict on Children (1996), which was produced by the human rights expert Graça Machel.</p>



<p><strong>● Physical injuries, Health issues, and death:</strong> The 1996 report was particularly concerned with the use of younger children, presenting evidence that many thousands of children were being killed, maimed, and psychiatrically injured around the world every year. In addition to injuries, child soldiers may face a variety of other health problems, including malnutrition, poor hygiene, and health care, respiratory and skin infections, and punishment by physical abuse or deprivation.</p>



<p><strong>● Drug addiction:</strong> Some armed groups force children to use drugs to desensitize them to violence and enhance their performance. The use of cocaine, amphetamines, and other stimulants is especially common. These drugs can cause lasting harm to the bodies and minds of child soldiers. Children leaving armed groups that force drug use may have a difficult time overcoming drug addiction and withdrawal.</p>



<p><strong>● Sexual exploitation: </strong>All child soldiers are vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation by others in the armed group. The risks are usually much higher for girls, and the exploitation of girls is rising too. Sexually abused girls are at high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Girls are at risk of unwanted pregnancies. These pregnancies can be very dangerous for the girls, who are often mal-nourished, physically immature, and living in unsanitary conditions.</p>



<p><strong>● Psychological distress:</strong> In addition to the physical vulnerabilities they face, child soldiers’ social and psychological development is often damaged by their experience in the armed group. Children are routinely exposed to terrible acts of violence and brutality. Researches have found that more than half of former child soldiers show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and are more likely than other children to exhibit aggression and anti-social behavior.</p>



<p><strong>● Poverty and Unemployment:</strong> The combined impact of all mentioned effects typically includes a high risk of poverty and lasting unemployment in adulthood.</p>



<h4>International Laws and International Efforts</h4>



<p>International efforts at protecting the rights of children started in 1924 with the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child.</p>



<p>● The Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child was just five Articles adopted by the League of Nations, stating that “mankind owes to the Child the best that it has to give, declare and accept it as their duty that, beyond and above all considerations of race, nationality or creed” (League of Nations, 1924, paragraph 1). Following this legislation, the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of the Child was adopted in 1959 which consisted of 10 principles to ensure for all children that “he [and she] may have a happy childhood and enjoy for his [and⁷ her] own good and for the good of society the rights and freedoms herein set forth” (United Nations, 1959, The General Assembly). Following these short declarations, in 1989 a 54-Article long Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified with thorough explanations of who is considered a child and the responsibilities of the state to ensure protection and education to children in their varying cultural and political contexts (United Nations, 1989).</p>



<p>● Then in 1997 Cape Town Principles, although not a legal document, was adopted. These principles represent an important consensus among major international NGOs and UNICEF and offer useful guidance in developing policies and programs that protect and support child soldiers. In addition to defining key terms, the principles provide a comprehensive overview of appropriate action related to the prevention of recruitment, demobilization, and reintegration of child soldiers.</p>



<p>● Later the 2009 list of the Six Grave Violations Against Children During Armed Conflict tried to expand the responsibility and efforts of citizens and governments on an international level to intervene in and prevent the recruitment of child soldiers, protect the rights of children, and to react to the engagement of children in warfare.(United Nations, 2002; United Nations, 2013; UNICEF, 1997; UNICEF 2007).</p>



<p>● The highest standard in the world is set by the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which forbids state armed forces from recruiting children under the age of 18 under any circumstances. It further requires State Parties to protect civilians and ensure respect for all rules of international humanitarian law applicable to children in all armed conflict, including internal conflict. Most African states have ratified the Charter.<br>Now, although international laws and principles, have undoubtedly been framed and adopted to restrict the recruitment of child soldiers, surely the main factor that makes legislation effective is the consequences of violation. These documents, however, are declarations, proclamations, conventions, and statements of best practices. Therefore, only countries who are members of the United Nations, sign the optional protocol(OPAC), and subscribe to the ideas and articles presented in the other documents are expected to abide by them. While countries may be highlighted by human rights watch organizations, “shamed” by the UN secretary-general, or other countries may refuse to engage in trade with them, there are rarely any concrete and legal consequences unless initiated and handed out by the governing state.</p>



<h4><strong>Role of UN</strong></h4>



<p>● The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and others have called for an end to the recruitment of children by state armed forces, arguing that military training, the military environment, and abiding contract of service are not compatible with children&#8217;s rights and jeopardize healthy development during adolescence.</p>



<p><strong>● Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict:</strong> The already mentioned Machel Report of 1996 also led to a new mandate for a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG-CAAC). Among the tasks of the SRSG is to draft the Secretary-General&#8217;s annual report on children and armed conflict, which lists and describes the worst situations of child recruitment and use from around the world. (Taken from &#8220;Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict&#8221;)</p>



<p><strong>● Security Council:</strong> The United Nations Security Council convenes regularly to debate, receive reports, and pass resolutions under the heading &#8220;Children in armed conflict&#8221;. United Nations Secretary-General In 2011 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon raised the issue of children in conflict areas who are involved in violent activities according to the Extreme Measures report.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>Child soldiers are being utilized all over the globe and thousands of violations of international declarations occur every year. These violations are easiest to track through the United Nations Secretary-General’s report. The most significant efforts to decrease and eliminate the use of child soldiers lie in getting more countries and non-state sanctioned military organisations on board with the Children, Not Soldiers campaigns and to pledge to prohibit military involvement for anyone under the age of 18. Countries, all over the world, must powerfully and effectively incorporate the international laws for the protection of children in their domestic legislation. Yet, of course, the most effective way to stop the use of child soldiers is to end the conflicts in which they fight. &#8220;Child soldiers will be used by [warring] parties for as long as the war continues. There must be a political solution, and conflicts must be resolved, as many as possible.<br></p>
