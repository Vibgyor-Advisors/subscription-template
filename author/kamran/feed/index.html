<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Human Rights are the basic universal and inalienable rights and fundamental freedom guaranteed to every individual against any inhumane and arbitrary treatment. These are the inherited rights granted equally to all human beings irrespective of ethnicity, nationality, race, color, sex, religion, or otherwise. The basis of Human rights is to treat everyone without any discrimination which includes civil, political, economical, social, and cultural rights in order to keep society equitable.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>These rights are not just abstract concepts but set out the necessary standards for people to live a dignified life. Human rights define the relationship between an individual and country and demands guaranteed protection from any unfair treatment and discrimination. Human Rights set out the choice for subjects to choose their govt. They are free to choose any form of Govt., whether democratic or non-democratic. In democracies, people can easily voice an opinion on their choice of the ruler while in non- democratic countries, it depends on the nature of the will of people to choose their ruler to whom they have submitted their wills.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Origin&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Human rights are thought to have developed differently in different cultures and philosophies. People around the world have different concepts of basic human rights based on their religion, political affiliations, or other factors. Human rights were first seen to originate from religious beliefs. It was believed to be God-given and human beings adopted those beliefs as opposed to natural rights. Later philosophers from early modern Europe like Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke developed new norms and traditions. Natural rights were not seen as merely moral claims but they were considered to reflect the most fundamental human drives leading to truly human existence. By the late eighteenth century, such ideas were used as a means of constraining the government&#8217;s sphere of autonomy as was expressed in the US Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and in the Citizen (1789). It acquired an international dimension when the Congress of Vienna attempted to abolish the slave trade which was eventually achieved by the Brussels Convention (1890) and formally outlawed by the Slavery Convention (1926). The horrendous memories of WWII, especially the “Final Solution” to Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs in the extermination camps of Nazi Germany, established a modern agenda for human rights at the international forums. The UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and human rights violations affected the domestic policies as well as informed the foreign policy decisions of states, which were until then given second class status at the expense of “national security”.</p>



<p>As far as non-democratic states are considered the chances of human rights violations are more given the lack of accountability of the governments towards their respective subjects. There is no system of check and balance, no free press, and no fair trial. This can make the conditions worse for the dissidents as citizens can be penalized on vague charges and face indefinite detention. In some of the non- democratic, authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Venezuela, Jordan, Cuba, Turkmenistan innumerable gross human rights violations have been reported and people are unable to get it redressed till now.</p>



<h4>Social Perception Around The Issue</h4>



<p>According to a Journal Published on “Citizens’ Perceptions of Human Rights Practices: An Analysis of 55 Countries” by Matthew Carlson and Ola Listhaug; The concept of Human Rights is said to be accepted differently in society and there is a limited agreement to what human rights actually means. They gave an example that most scholars accept the argument that Human rights are rights which include civil, political, economic, and social aspects as mentioned under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, they mention that recent global comparisons of human rights practices are likely to be concerned with narrow concepts that focus on ‘individual integrity’ i.e., the right to be free from torture, imprisonment, execution, or disappearance.</p>



<p>Further, it is agreed upon that Citizens of oppressive countries are likely to have more negative perceptions than citizens of countries with more appreciative human rights records and even believed that highly educated individuals are more analytical towards human rights violations in repressive societies than in less repressive societies. It is mentioned that the level of political terror within a country’s age, gender, opinion of an individual, will have a different approach of human rights conditions, depending on their life experiences, opportunities, and the amount of&nbsp;information available to them.</p>



<h4><strong>Non-Democratic Countries And Human Rights Violations Analysis:</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia has a Kingdom of monarchy ruled by King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is both head of state and head of Government. The Government has been responsible for various human rights issues like executions for non-violent offences, forced disappearance, and torture. The people are denied the right to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The Government has harassed, arbitrarily detained, and prosecuted dozens of government critics, activists, including women’s rights activists and members of the Shi’a community.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association and Belief</h4>



<p>Saudi authorities continue to repress free thinkers, human rights activists, and independent clerics. Activists have been sentenced to long term imprisonments for charges arising from their peaceful activism. Four prominent activists—Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sadah, and Nouf Abdulaziz—have been imprisoned and remained in detention without any trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Saudi authorities opened a separate trial of prominent human rights activists, Nassima al-Sadah and Samar Badawi before the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, where charges against them have not been made public. Saudi Arabia does not tolerate public worship by followers of religions other than Islam. Saudi Arabia has no written laws concerning gender identity, and judges use principles of Islamic law to sanction people committing sexual relations outside marriage, adultery, extra-marital affairs, and homosexuality.</p>



<h4>Criminal Justice System</h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia applies Sharia (Islamic law) as its national law. On April 23, 2019, a mass execution of 37 men was carried out in various parts of the country. At least 33 were from the country’s minority Shia community who had been convicted following unfair trials for various alleged crimes, including protest-related offenses, espionage, and terrorism. According to Interior Ministry statements, Saudi Arabia executed 179 persons between January and mid-November for murder and drug crimes. Eighty-one among those executed were convicted for non-violent drug crimes. Executions are carried out by firing squad or beheading, sometimes in public.</p>



<h4>Right Granted in its Entirety </h4>



<p>Women and girls continued to face systematic discrimination in law and in practice in other areas such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and the ability to pass on citizenship to their children.</p>



<p>Shi’a Muslims continued to face discrimination because of their faith, limiting their right to express religious beliefs and access justice, as well as their right to work in a number of public sector professions and access state services.</p>



<p>Some migrant workers suffer abuses and exploitation, sometimes amounting to conditions of forced labor. The kafala (visa sponsorship) system ties migrant workers’ residency permits to “sponsoring” employers, whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country under normal circumstances. Some employers confiscate passports, withhold wages, and force migrants to work against their will.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>hina</h4>

<p>In China, the human rights condition continues to worsen. The justice system remains in trouble because of unfair trials, torture, and ill-treatment during detention. LGBTI people face widespread discrimination and stigma in society. Due to inadequate medical services, they take serious risks by seeking unregulated and improper gender-affirming treatments. LGBTI people also face abuses in the form of “conversion therapy”.</p>



<p>The government continues to intimidate, harass, and prosecute human rights defenders and independent NGOs, by raiding their homes and offices. Even the family members of the activists are being harassed and detained. They are put under police surveillance and restrained from any movement.</p>



<h4><strong>J</strong>ustice System</h4>



<p>President Xi Jinping proposes to bring the legal system under the ambit of the Chinese Communist Party’s absolute leadership. Law enforcement and the judicial system remains largely under the control of the party. China has legalized arbitrary and secret detention, such as “residential surveillance in a designated location” and an extrajudicial system of detention (Liuzzi). These plans allow for solitary confinement which increases the risk of torture and other ill-treatment.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Religion and Belief</h4>



<p>The government has strengthened its restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. The authorities rigorously censor all media, from print media to online games.</p>



<p>Chinese authorities continue to tighten its grip on Christians and Muslims as China pushes ahead with the “sanitization of religion”, with a view to combating any religious activity. Many Buddhist and Taoist temples and statues, along with mosques and churches, are being damaged or destroyed at the direction of the government. There are various reports about the detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups continued in Xinjiang in “vocational training centers”, also known as “transformation-through-education” centers. An estimated up to one million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minority people were sent to concentration camps. Many religious figures, intellectuals, and academics have been detained in Xinjiang merely for exercising their rights to freedom of religion and expression.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>LGBTI people continue to face discrimination at home, at work, in schools, and in public. The authorities accept and claim to have implemented all recommendations on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression at the end of the country’s review process in the third cycle of the UN Universal Periodic Review in 2018. Two recommendations requested prohibition against discrimination in legislation, but there is no law that explicitly protects LGBTI people from discrimination.</p>



<p>The Human Rights defenders (HRDs) have been unable to commit to their work without any interference from the Government. The authorities systematically subject them to surveillance, harassment, intimidation, detention, and imprisonment. Many activists and HRDs continue to be prosecuted on vague and overly broad charges such as “subverting state power”, “inciting subversion of state power” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. Many are held in “residential surveillance in a designated location” on suspicion of involvement in state security crimes. This form of detention allows the police to detain individuals suspected of such crimes for up to six months in an unknown location outside the formal detention system, with suspects denied access to legal counsel and families.</p>



<h4><strong>Jordan</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A woman raises a Jordanian national flag as she stands amidst public school teachers demonstrating and demanding pay raises at the Professional Associations Complex in Jordan&#8217;s capital, Amman, on 3 October 2019. </strong></p>



<p>The authorities detain journalists and activists critical of the government or the King, demonstrators for demanding their and others’ release, as well as block websites of activists abroad.&nbsp; Jordan is a member of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the armed conflict in Yemen.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression and Assembly</h4>



<p>In February 2019,&nbsp; parliament’s lower house refused to enact a draft of cybercrime law presented by the government on the basis that the definitions were vague and that some provisions contradicted the penal code; the definition of hate speech was overly broad and risked severely curtailing freedom of expression. The authorities have blocked access to websites set up by Jordanian activists abroad seeking to record political developments and arrests of activists in Jordan. The authorities harass and detain activists and journalists who criticize the government or King Abdullah. Public protests organised without permission are stopped with arrest and detentions and demonstrators are made to sign a pledge that they would refrain from participating in the future.</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>Administrative detention against women is used usually for months and for discriminatory reasons, such as for being “absent from home” without a male guardian’s permission, or for having sex outside marriage (Zina), begging, or homeless. Women who become pregnant outside marriage face authoritarian detention and forcible abortion.</p>



<p>Citizenship laws of Jordan are biased against children of Jordanian mothers and non-Jordanian fathers, who, contrary to children of Jordanian fathers marry non-Jordanians, are denied Jordanian citizenship.</p>



<p>The Family Protection Department and the Ministry of Social Development continue to forcibly abort the babies from unmarried women, without consideration of the best interests of the child and mother.</p>



<p>Migrant domestic workers have been facing abuse by their employers and agents, and remain at risk of arbitrary detention by the state. They are detained after fleeing their employer&#8217;s residence without permission. Those under-privileged who seek work in order to earn money need attention from the state for their upliftment.</p>



<h4><strong>North Korea</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A commuter reads a newspaper while waiting for a train at a newsstand in a subway station in Pyongyang on June 19, 2019, ahead of a visit to the North Korean capital by Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 20. Xi will be the first Chinese leader to visit Pyongyang in 14 years. </strong></p>



<p>North Korea is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world with Kim Jong Un serving as head of government and ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, uses threats of execution, arbitrary punishment of crimes, detention, and forced labor to maintain fearful obedience. It continues restrictions on travel outside the country and incommunicado with the outside world.</p>



<p>The government doesn’t tolerate dissent. It has banned independent media, civil society, and trade unions, The Regime also schematically denies basic rights, including freedom of expression, association, and religion. It systematically extracts forced, unpaid labor from its citizens to build infrastructure and implement public projects. The government also fails to protect or promote the rights of numerous at-risk groups, including women, children, and people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2014 United Nations Commission of Inquiry (COI) report on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea)&nbsp; briefed that the government has committed crimes against humanity, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, and forced abortion. It recommended the UN Security Council refer the situation to the International Criminal Court.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>In 2019, Kim Jong Un’s government barred people from leaving North Korea without a permit, by blocking Chinese mobile phone services at the border, aiming to arrest those communicating with people outside the country or trying to leave, and broadcasting punishments imposed on persons caught escaping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The North Korean government systematically requires forced, uncompensated labor from most of its population—including workers at state-owned enterprises or deployed overseas, women, children, and prisoners—to control its people and sustain its economy. A majority of North Koreans are supposed to perform unpaid labor, often called “portrayals of loyalty” at some time in their lives. North Korea is one of the only seven UN member states that has not joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) and during the Universal Periodic Review, the government did not accept recommendations. This also goes against equality and ethical standards of treatment of labours.</p>



<h4><strong>Vietnam</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Environmental activist Nguyen Ngoc Anh (c) stands in a courtroom in June 2019 during his trial in Vietnam’s Ben Tre province, in which he was sentenced to six years in prison for “undermining” the government via his Facebook posts.</strong></p>



<p>In Vietnam, the Government has been committing various inhumane acts against human rights activists and has actively breached a number of human rights resolutions.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly</h4>



<p>Government has arbitrarily put restrictions on uploading content on Google, Youtube, and other online platforms. Media-censorship, limiting content, ads, and any news which is politically sensitive is termed as fake news. A court in Dong Nai sentenced two Facebook users, Vu Thi Dung and Nguyen Thi Ngoc Suong, to six years and five years’ imprisonment respectively, for reading and listening to materials on Facebook and distributing leaflets calling on people to protest against China and state oppression. They were charged with possessing materials “that aim to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam”.</p>



<p>Vietnam has banned the formation of independent labor unions, human rights organizations, and political parties. Those who dare to establish workers&#8217; unions face harassment, intimidation, and retribution. Labor activist Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung was imprisoned for helping to organize a strike in Tra Vinh province in 2010. Police immediately placed him under intrusive surveillance. Even after ratifying International Labor Convention 98 on collective bargaining and the right to organize unrecognized religious groups, Christian, and Buddhist groups face constant harassment and intimidation from the government. Followers of independent religious groups are subjected to public criticism, forced renunciation of faith, detention, interrogation, torture, and imprisonment.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Despite ratifying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various other human rights treaties, these states have been found grossly violating them and committing human rights violations on its citizens. Right to life, liberty, freedom of expression, right to dissent, protest, freedom of the press is being violated day in and day out. In order to bring justice and promote human rights, international communities and organisations need to put pressure on these states to amend laws, investigate crimes, and bring perpetrators to justice in courts.</p>



<p>There is an immense need for positive change vis a vis human rights, especially in authoritarian non-democratic states because the human rights situation continues to remain grim. Especially we can say this in the post- COVID 19 world because the governments all over the world are stepping into the sphere of individual rights and the states, in the facade of controlling the disease, are actively using intrusive surveillance techniques. There is also a role to play for human rights organisations to make the general population in non-democratic countries aware of the importance of human rights and put pressure on their respective governments so that every individual irrespective of his race, gender, religion, or ethnicity gets to live a life that is free from fear, intimidation or harassment.</p>
