<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>



<p>Africa, being a large continent is prone to diverse issues and problems like high prevalence of communicable diseases, low incomes, malnutrition, poorly staffed services, low life expectancy and the like. The most crucial amongst such problems is mental health issues of children which remains unaddressed to a very large extent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of The major causes of growing psychological problems in the continent are increasing poverty, wars, natural disasters and other such sorts of violence and social unrest. It has been revealed that the element of depression alone is going to be the second biggest burden of all health conditions by 2030</p>



<p>In Africa, a plethora of mental health problems exist among children consisting of half of the population of the region. It is estimated that of the children aged between&nbsp; 0 to 9 years, about 3 % suffer from mental disorders. Many suffer from poor psychological development because of neglect either by their mothers or other caretakers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OF CHILDREN</strong></h3>



<p>Child and adolescent mental health is defined by the WHO as the capacity to achieve and maintain optimal psychological functioning and well being. It is directly related to the competence achieved and level reached in psychological and social functioning.</p>



<p>It includes an idea of identity and self-worth, sound family and peer relations, an ability to learn and be productive and capacity to use cultural resources and developmental challenges to maximize development.</p>



<p>However, if there are patterns or changes in thinking, behaving or feeling that causes distress or disrupts a person’s ability to function it implies mental illness or mental health disorder. The&nbsp; mental health disorder includes problems like disruptions or delays in developing age, inappropriate thinking, deviant behaviors, unregulated emotions or social skills which distress children and thereby disrupt their ability to function well in life.</p>



<p>In many African countries, the most usual presentation of psychosis is acute transient psychosis, paranoid psychosis and psychosis resulting from cerebral involvement in infectious diseases which produce temporary disability but may prove to be fatal if not treated properly.</p>



<p>The children growing up in such regions&nbsp; are usually exposed to extremely crucial experiences, who became hardly compatible with physical as well as emotional survival. Unless these toxic environments are addressed by the systems of care, improvement in the mental health of the children is a goal unachievable.</p>



<p>&nbsp;There are some human resources dedicated to the mental health of children. The pushes of the World Health Organization to include mental health in the millennium development goals have improved the profile of child mental health to a very large extent. However, there are certain challenges to the development of appropriate comprehensive child mental health services in Africa. The primary challenges say for instance are socio-economic circumstances and demographic complexities.</p>



<p>In Africa,both a formal as well as informal system of mental health care for children. Though the formal systems of care have been largely eroded by war or poverty but the informal system of care which includes care by family, by indigenous healers or NGO’s are to the large extent developed. For instance, the NGO&#8217;S like The Ape Action Africa, the Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), the Etijah and the like launch certain programs that provide a great help in addressing the issues of orphans and vulnerable and thereby come to the rescue of poor and mentally ill children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for proper care of needy children, both care systems are important and both must work together and complement each other as both are interdependent, for a formal care system can’t effectively address the issue having social context without consulting the informal system of care. Similarly the informal system of care depends on a formal system for specialized training and supervision.</p>



<h3>CURRENT SITUATION IN AFRICA</h3>



<p>In Africa, mental health problems have assumed greater attention. The continent&#8217;s population grew by 49% between 2000 to 2015&nbsp; and is expected to double by next three decades. There is constant pressure on young people who struggle to earn a livelihood in highly competitive labor markets. It is believed that they may face psychological problems because of their failure to realize ambitions or may turn to substance misuse for alleviating their frustrations.</p>



<p>The member states of the world health assembly in 2013, committed to the Mental Health Action Plan, whereby they pledged to enhance service coverage for severe mental health disorders by 20% by 2020 and to reduce suicide rates by 10%.</p>



<p>But the fact remains that health in general is still a poorly funded area of social services in most African countries, morality happening mostly by infectious diseases and malnutrition and morbidity and disablement due to mental illness receive little attention from the government. Mental services in particular continue to be poorly developed with no mental policies, programs or action plans.</p>



<h3>RELIEF PROGRAMS &amp; GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES</h3>



<p>The member states of the African region of the world health organization adopted two resolutions in 1988 and 1990 to improve mental health services with the main aim to formulate mental health policies, programs and action plans.</p>



<p>Two years later, a survey was conducted to see if the countries adopting the resolutions have done anything in this regard. Though there were some modest achievements yet the situation of mental health programs in most of the countries including Africa was unsatisfactory.</p>



<p>WHO in its African Regional Strategy for Mental Health in the year 2020, emphasized that populations in the African region are occupied by various mental and neurological disorders happening to be the major cause of disability. To address this issue, WHO is undertaking a large number of&nbsp; welfare projects with the aim to promote mental health services in Africa by strengthening mental health policies and implementing regional strategies to prompt mental health and thereby prevent mental, psychological and neurological disorders. In the long run, WHO intends to reduce disability associated with mental, psychological and neurological disorders through community based rehabilitation.</p>



<h3>HOW TO SOCIALLY UPLIFT THE AFFECTED?</h3>



<p>Mental disorders are counted among the top ten causes of disability in Africa the burden of which on health issues is going to rise making it inevitable to give this issue the attention and resources it needs.</p>



<p>While planning the system of child mental health care in Africa, two important factors that need to be taken into account include firstly, the moral value system&nbsp; and cultural specific world views of Africa, Asia, Arab and Caucasian people and secondly the social context in which children grow.</p>



<p>It is the need of the hour that authorities in power should develop psychiatry and mental health care. The mental health policies should be strengthened and regional strategies should be adopted and implemented to prompt mental health and mental, neurological and psychological disorders. The drug abuse related problems should be prevented. Community based rehabilitation is required to be launched for reducing disability associated with neurological, mental and psychoactive substances.</p>



<p>People’s perceptions are usually influenced by traditional beliefs in supernatural causes and remedies which leads to unhelpful or health damaging responses to mental illness and stigmatization of mentally ill persons. The negative perception of people as well as policy makers regarding mental and neurological disorders should be changed through various awareness programs and by formulating or reviewing existing legislation in support of mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equitable access should be provided to cost-effective mental, neurological and psychosocial care.</p>



<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>



<p>In order to improve the deteriorating situation of mental health services in Africa, there is dire for authorities to lay focus on the system of health care available for patients in general and children in particular. It should be the priority of the policy makers and authorities in power to make inpatient psychiatric services available at least for children suffering from psychiatric disorders.</p>



<p>Like other countries, the primary health care model has been adopted in Africa long ago but the mental health services were made vertical recently which however is largely based in mental hospitals, catering mainly for adults. Secondary and tertiary outpatient services for children have been started in some areas but only South Africa and Senegal have made inpatient Psychiatric services available for children.</p>



<p>when there is lack of general psychiatric services for children, Other sectors of medical care systems have correspondingly a greater responsibility in meeting mental health needs of patients in Africa and until the general psychiatric services are made available, other sectors are morally under the obligation to step forward and contribute to the humanitarian cause of coming to the rescue of helpless and devastated children. Disciplines like maternal and child health departments, pediatrics, schools, social welfare services, juvenile justice systems and prisons though general, fairly basic and non-specialized but are the obvious ones that have to play a role in contributing to the noble cause of maintaining the mental stability of children.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;The U.S relations with Mexico could be regarded as indispensable because of the fact that the countries share land and maritime border in North America. Several treaties have been concluded between the two nations such as the Gadsden Purchase (an agreement between the U.S and Mexico, in which the U.S agreed to pay Mexico $10million for a 2, 09,670 square mile portion of Mexico) and the <strong>North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA)</strong> (an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico and U.S, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America). Both are members of the various international organizations including the organization of the American States and the United Nations.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that both countries have close diplomatic, economic, and socio-cultural relations, illegal immigration and illegal trade in drugs and firearms continue to be the causes of differences between the two countries.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin</strong></h4>



<p>The first border dispute between The United States and Mexico arose because of the reason for migration. In an effort to control the inflow of English-speaking settlers, Mexico banned immigration to Texas from The United States. With the independence of Texas from Mexico in 1845, it became a part of The United States as a slave state by the efforts of the then Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. As a result of the independence of Texas, Mexico ended up its diplomatic relations with the United States.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in a fix to make the Rio Grande River the border between The United States and Mexico which would make Texas part of The United States, the then U.S President James Polk in 1845 offered to purchase California and New Mexico from the Mexican government which in turn was refused. As a mark of retaliation to the refusal, Polk sent military forces to the Rio Grande, and a full-scale US invasion followed with the seizure of Mexico City.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="407" height="210" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kjB0Ve6XDR8UgMR7LaYNR7G4AXQJ7IJZPr5IX3JuGXmdI3Dr95NlbhX9Gp38gMNpeOCNeh9AlYQ6dRx4vFs2Ho9nmhksPURtbPXDQJY4e0-317kWRJrTNE-QbpXBd8R-NS4nkri_"></p>



<p>Thereafter, the peace treaty of <strong>Guadalupe</strong> <strong>Hidalgo</strong> was signed ending the Mexican-American war which obligated Mexico to relinquish present-day Arizona, California, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and Nevada. In return for the war-related damage to the Mexican land, $15 million in compensation was paid by The U.S. In addition to this, the peace treaty also provided for the protection of the property and civil rights of the roughly 80,000 Mexican nationals living in The U.S.</p>



<p>In 1853, the then U.S President Franklin Pierce planned to construct a railroad to the Pacific ocean for which he purchased 30,000 square miles of land along the Mesilla Valley which runs from California to El Paso for $10 million. The Gadsden Purchase marks the last adjustment to the border between Mexico and The United States and also the resolution for an indispensable border dispute between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;Cross Border Issues</strong></h4>



<p>The U.S- Mexican relations have usually remained friendly, nevertheless, periodic tensions have emerged over some major as well as minor issues including trade disputes, immigration, border security issues, drug trafficking, border environmental issues, and water resource issues respectively.</p>



<h4>Drug Trafficking&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Drug trafficking is a global illicit trade involving the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of substances that are subject to drug prohibition laws.</p>



<p>Mexico plays a major role in the US drug control policy as it is the primary source of and transit country for illicit drugs like heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine, fentanyl. Besides, Mexico is also a major transit country for cocaine produced in the Andean region of South America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fWZTs8sSSUU2-1TpfTHRNLiQgJ_ZIUUfln5lgpzVGnslhPx6BV8VKhXnQFaCy3AvoI5-J9Y2W2WcJXKDY7pTznmMPIzQTAxjeO8VI4n2ahrMpX3iAiQNc1YgwffUQkDrDuDvQ6j3" alt=""/></figure>



<p>According to the Drug Enforcement administration (it is an agency tasked with combating drug trafficking and distribution within the United States) 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican drug trafficking organisations which are involved in<strong> drug trafficking</strong>,<strong> money laundering</strong>, and other violent crime continue to pose a greatest criminal threat to the United States.</p>



<p>In 1969, an aggressive search and seizure counternarcotics operation was launched on the U.S Mexico border, by the then U.S President Richard Nixon while declaring “war on drugs”. The government of the United States deployed the agents for the purpose of inspecting all the persons and vehicles crossing into The United States through the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GNUFpZZZsUCtSY6OIrEx9IwZ6h9SzjE9E_oWL63fWjzN1cYNkWRNZt0c3ITEzNKDL3WnYFBw4wABrQSgQBQmB5LFJrfdzjHHrp43jDdPojPIYW-UC5HZxRdVJOoA-kbVsVG3qzbV" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The United States created the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA and there was some counternarcotics cooperation in the 1970s and 80s. However, the killing of one of its DEA agents in Mexico sparked outrage in The United States which led them to pursue the <strong>unilateral strategy to fight the war on drugs</strong>.</p>



<p>Data on drug seizures at the U.S. border indicate an alarming volume of trafficking taking place in recent years. Since 2009, heroin seizures at the southwestern border have almost tripled, while meth seizures quintupled. However, cocaine and marijuana remain two of the most commonly seized drugs along the southern borders, equating to millions of pounds seized by the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>



<p>Since 2012, the number of traffickers apprehended at U.S. borders has steadily increased from 364,768 to nearly 500,000 in 2014. From 2012 to 2015 the U.S. Border Patrol has seized more than:</p>



<p><strong>8.2 million lbs. of marijuana</strong></p>



<p><strong>32,600 lbs. of cocaine</strong></p>



<p><strong>34,000 ounces of heroin</strong></p>



<p><strong>17,600 lbs. of methamphetamine</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7TMDOoQh6GGd4LUJZPZf3gxZd4Ui6buMH1gGfjYaeVQGcN1Nc2qtz6aBDH1wMHcAYGeV8U3GVWjMtH39bH-UVVF6pvE36zOo_De9MboaXTYWgBLRzOUuw0nzAhL1edEb3fXixs9n" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, despite the high volume of search &amp; seizure programs that have effectively stopped millions of pounds of illicit drugs from entering the&nbsp; U.S,&nbsp; drugs are still finding their way across and have a profound impact in many states along southern and coastal borders.</p>



<h4><strong>Unauthorised Immigration&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Unauthorized immigration refers to the migration of people into a country in violation of the immigration laws of that country or the continued residence of people without the legal right to live in that country.</p>



<p>Unauthorized immigration has always been a subject of greater concern between The US and Mexico with much emphasis on how to prevent unauthorized migration and address the large population of illegal migrants living in the United States. Mexico being the largest source of unauthorized migrants in The United States, the U.S migration policies including stepped-up border and interior enforcement have primarily affected Mexicans as more Mexicans have been leaving the United States than arriving. However, the Mexicans living in the United States, including those who are unauthorized remain the top priority of the Mexican government.&nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="497" height="289" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R1S_Xr_TH953RI-AZtFngmkrIRYvb5xzwp3IQsr2DaTOI-DGjyHUUGdxGQl6dZZwXTEB2L94uXW2iHu6oeLxv2cKTfG8MWpbIrYs751Aqu4KhGSVH6s4h2eQO19q-xNJyjI8eY8l"></p>



<p><em>Undocumented Guatemalans carry their belongings after crossing the Guatemala-Mexico border</em></p>



<p>While the concern of the US government over unauthorized immigration was on peak in the 1990s, it came up with the strategy for tracking down the unauthorized immigrants living in the&nbsp; United States including the enforcement plan increasing border security and granting power to local law enforcement in the Border States to uphold immigration laws.</p>



<p>Since the mid-2000, successive Mexican governments have supported efforts to enact the Immigration reform in the United States, while being careful not to appear infringing upon US authority to make and enforce immigration laws. Mexico has made efforts to combat transmigration by unauthorized migrants and worked with US law enforcement to combat alien smuggling and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eYSimq8twEwPJCU6EMBiyVTVKEwRN4Vn6FQtI-t0UOD5mlXrwG1HdZblO2zsMeACeCuY3M5K1y3Abnt5pNBQGnOdXcr_Go2rM-XQvsM1c1ugzsLPGbmD7haEAuj4jPVvl9HfOaZu" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>NAFTA and USMCA</strong></h4>



<p>In 1980, the then US President Ronal Reagan put forth the idea of the <strong>North American Free Trade </strong>Zone as a part of his presidential campaign. After signing the Canada-United States free trade agreement in 1988, the governments of the US, Mexico, and Canada agreed to negotiate on what became NAFTA but even after ratification of the agreement by their respective capitals, NAFTA faced significant opposition in both US and Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQ-1CaWpYLLpg4JHSeR1uYIdH0bAX3idFKX081cB76qDQVhHMsMMZqjKt_cpA8VAS-ZCvFQU0sAmREweX5zhl1EcfAfylM90o0MMH-RAW3ohUS7fTmRYAoibo47Yi8AkedV-O2Br" alt="" width="595" height="429"/></figure>



<p>Eventually, all the three countries ratified NAFTA in 1993, and finally, it came into force a year later, after the addition of the two side agreements to it, The North American Agreement on Labor cooperation NAALC (it is the side agreement to NAFTA under which each of the three countries that are parties to NAFTA agreed to enforce their own labor standards and to strive to improve labor standards in their country) and The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation NAAEC (it is an environmental agreement between the US Canada and Mexico as a&nbsp; side treaty to NAFTA which sets out objectives concerning the conservation and the protection of the environment as well as concrete measures to further cooperation on the matters between the three countries).</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of NAFTA:</strong></h4>



<p>•<strong> NAFTA</strong> <strong>eliminated barriers to trade and investment</strong> between the US, Canada, and Mexico.</p>



<p>• It <strong>eliminated most tariffs</strong> with the major focus on liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobile manufacturing.</p>



<p>• The agreement also sought to protect intellectual property, establish dispute resolution mechanisms and through side agreements, implement labor and environmental safeguards.</p>



<p>• NAFTA fundamentally<strong> proved beneficial to North American economies </strong>and the average citizens but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.</p>



<p>On the other hand, critics of the agreement argue that it was to be blamed for job losses, wage stagnation driven by low wage competition, and a widening trade deficit.</p>



<p>After US President Donald Trump took office in 2017, all the three signatories a year later reached an agreement to modernize the 25-year-old NAFTA with the <strong>United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)</strong> and all the three countries had ratified it in 2020. The USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020, replacing NAFTA. The new United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and strong economic growth.</p>



<h4>Cross Border Environmental Issues&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Environmental health and environmental quality issues along the US-Mexico border have always been a concern for several years. Transboundary and shared resources and conflict include the flow of raw sewage and industrial wastewater into the United States from Mexico which has caused health and environmental problems in the border region.</p>



<p>Wastewater collection and treatment system capacity has not kept pace with rapid population growth in the border region. Also, the aging of existing wastewater infrastructure has resulted in increased maintenance issues such as pipeline ruptures. To address border sanitation issues, International Boundary and Water Commission <strong>(IBWC)</strong>, The US Environmental Protection Agency <strong>(EPA)</strong>, and the North American Development Bank<strong> (NADB)</strong> have been engaged to construct wastewater infrastructure on both sides of the border.</p>



<h4><strong>Recent Development and Crisis</strong></h4>



<p>Since the beginning of Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign, U.S-Mexico relations have been in crisis. The bilateral relationships between the two countries have been seriously affected by Trump’s criticism of Mexico and its people, his threats to deport millions of undocumented Mexicans, his desire to build what he calls a <strong>“beautiful wall”</strong> on the southern border, and his express intention to abandon NAFTA. For Mexico officials and intellectuals, the current state of affairs has reached the lowest point in the two countries&#8217; relationship over the last 25 years.</p>



<p><strong>President Trump refocused the Merida initiative</strong> through executive orders on combating transnational criminal organizations and enhancing border security. Though Trump has praised Mexico’s enhanced efforts to reduce migration flows but criticized Mexico’s anti-drug performance. On the proposal of the Mexican government in 2019, a high-level security working group, with a view to combating organized crime and cross-border crime, was agreed to be created by the U.S government which includes the Merida initiative as one aspect of bilateral efforts.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">&nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="446" height="255" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UGZoOgorhfNXsWf39fCBNdvXsxhU-ihZjcthXZtUchl4zENe6dIs115Q8--BEfVhmZNjOVPLS5gotxrsHxZafzAwnBImoMtnIj5p0f6FwASBZVcGKenKU96ViWXf8Brkt5kbnJ-J"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trump&#8217;s         <em>Border Wall</em></p>



<p>Throughout Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, he called for the construction of a bigger, more impenetrable border wall with a view to preventing illegal immigration from Mexico along the U.S-Mexico border. In furtherance of this proposal, The Trump administration two years later announced new rules to deny asylum to anyone crossing the United States illegally. However, Mexico has substantially opposed the construction of the border wall as well as the Trump administration&#8217;s immigration policy for the reason that Mexico places high importance on immigration, not only because millions of co-nationals live in the U.S but also because they send millions of dollars to the country.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SeSq-AGPSV8eXwvB4bGAqsPTzj7oaHOyO8QjusUDyvyutk118CrOh2fk0Zex6RsR9iSqxMwGAXOA3C7g_1Z-i-I_sg7T2nApTjytvkZiQMC59X4fznIZ6C6fGgzWuYndV83x44V-" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>For the first time over the last 25 years, the U.S-Mexico relations have withered away. The structural system that has prevailed for more than two decades is now under considerable threat. Although USMCA succeeded in the 25 years old NAFTA its future at present remains unpredictable. The nature of the bilateral relationship is likely to change substantially if the U.S implements its immigration reform which will have an enduring impact on the economies of both countries.</p>



<p>The U.S government’s immigration reforms and the modification in NAFTA have adversely affected Mexican nationalism and the perception of the U.S. Thus, the consequence of Trump’s campaign and his presidency has lead to the collapse of the bilateral relations between the two countries on one hand and strengthened the unity of Mexico’s citizens against the US Foreign policy on the other hand.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Data privacy is of greater importance in a world with ever-growing mountains of big data. During the earlier times, the consumers used to share their personal information or data via the offline platform where the chances of data privacy risks were minimal, however, with the growing technology, the consumers in this digital age share their vital information on the online platform, be it on social media sites, E-commerce sites and other Apps to perform certain kind of actions.</p>



<p>The concept of data privacy in this modern era is usually applied to critical personal information also known as Personally Identifiable Information. Such information is used for the purpose of identification of any person like the driver’s license number, bank account number, passport number, etc. and Personal Health Information in a medical record used for the identification of any person which was disclosed, created, or used in the course of providing a health care service. Of late with such a sensitive and personal data record, it becomes challenging when it attempts to use the data while protecting an individual’s personally identifiable information and privacy preferences.</p>



<h4><strong>Digitization of Services</strong></h4>



<p>While the consumers are sharing personal data on online platforms that collect growing amounts of information on the one hand, they have started visualising the danger in such data collection on the other hand. Data privacy has become more important in this digitalized world and those platforms collecting the vital information of an individual should be highly concerned with their data privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy </strong></h4>



<p>Primarily, privacy is the Right of a citizen of being free from public scrutiny or from having one’s personal information shared. Data Privacy is the right of the citizen to have control over how one’s personal information is collected and used. It deals with the practices which ensure that the data so shared by any person must be used for its intended purpose.</p>



<p>Most of the time, Data privacy is confused with Data security and is used interchangeably however, data privacy and data security are, by no means, the same terms.</p>



<p>Like, if you are using a Google Gmail account, your password would be a method of data security, while the way Google uses your data to administer your account would be data privacy.</p>



<p>Data security is a prerequisite to Data privacy therefore it is possible to have healthy security stand without addressing data privacy. However, it is not possible to ensure Data privacy without a solid security stand.</p>

<h4><strong>Data Privacy and Data Security</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2KHHHno84GIoPLml6egdIRtC3qUwPZSL9bAKfZaUI1VWU8IUNmof27Admq_NK2yVjxZIS5V95hg2b2ptpcoDxvZ5M5ZubUSfsGNUFk6iWz8uzI2TAcx6drqZDb3ER5cDDYjETP8g" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy a Real Major Concern</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In this age of digitization, personal data influences a lot of our activities. It affects nearly everything including from what content or messages we see on the internet to so many decisions made whether it’s about a job, a license, or a loan and thereby sway almost every aspect of our lives. Since the autonomy and control over our lives are one of the hallmarks of freedom which would be rendered useless if the important decisions about our lives are being made without our participation which might turn out to be one of the reasons which give rise to data privacy concerns.</p>



<p><strong>Various types of personal information that often come under privacy concerns may be listed as follows;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Financial Information</strong></h4>



<p>Any financial information which is shared online or offline is sensitive as it can be used maliciously by someone to commit fraud. In 2019, First American Financial Corp. had 885 million records exposed online including bank transactions, social security numbers, and more.</p>



<p>Data about an individual’s financial transaction like the positions held in stocks and funds, outstanding debts, amount of assets, and purchases is usually sensitive. The person concerned could be the victim of identity theft or fraud if the criminals get access to such information. Similarly, data about a person’s purchases can reveal a great lot of information like the medications used, places visited, contacts, activities, or habits. This data may also be used by the corporations for the purpose of targeting the individual concerned with marketing customized towards the personal preferences of those individuals which the person concerned may or may not approve.</p>



<h4><strong>Internet Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In the modern era, where most of the information is shared online be it on social networking sites or other Apps, people experience growing concern about privacy challenges. With the use of various search engines and data mining, it has become possible to collect and combine information from a wide variety of sources very easily.</p>



<p><strong>For instance the Aadhaar Data Breach:</strong></p>



<p> In 2018 there was a massive breach In India allowing access to private information of Aadhaar holders, exposing their names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and their bank details along with the photographs, thumbprints, retina scans, and other identifying details of nearly 1.1 billion citizens.</p>



<p>One of the most worrisome issues of today’s world is the ability of a third person to control the information one reveals over the internet and who can access that information, whether Email can be read or stored by third parties without consent if websites one visited can collect, store and possibly share the personal information, whether third parties can track the websites that someone visited, etc.</p>



<h4><strong>Locational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Locational Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Locational data is the most sensitive data being collected by tracking capabilities of mobile devices which have the potential to strip away locational privacy from individuals, making it possible to intrude into the lives of others by consulting location databases. In 2017, McDelivery leak disclosed home addresses and even exact coordinates of 2.2 million users.</p>



<p>By tracking the locational information, potentially sensitive professional and personal information like the presence of a person at an abortion clinic, an AIDS counselor, attendance of a religious place, etc. could be exposed which unfortunately poses a threat to locational privacy.</p>



<h4><strong>Medical Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Medical Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Confidentiality and privacy are essential to all trusting relationships such as that between a doctor and a patient. Patient confidentiality and protection of privacy have always been the basis of the doctor-patient relationship. People usually do not prefer that their medical records be revealed to others because of the fact that it may affect their medical insurance, employment, and that it may bring embarrassment upon them.</p>



<p>Medical privacy may include information relating to physical and sexual activity, genetic data, bodily functions, psychological problems, etc.</p>



<p>In 2018, the healthcare sector saw 15 million patient records compromised in 503 breaches, three times the amount seen in the previous year, according to the Protenus Breach Barometer.</p>



<h4><strong>Educational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In earlier days, photocopies, textbooks, and filmstrips supplied the entire educational content to the students. However, with the advancement of technology and telecommunications, the education system has greatly changed and a new system including personalized content, virtual forms of interaction, and interactive technologies has been introduced.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though the adopters of these technologies have proved their worth by transforming the educational process however, the use of high-tech education systems has proved to be a double-edged sword. Using information systems like Arcon and portal, tools like Microsoft Office and Google, educational Apps like Edmodo and Dropbox exposes the student data to a number of security and privacy risks. Technologies like information sharing, telecommunication innovations, and web-hosting also expose the information related to students to risks during their use.</p>



<p>In 2020, cybersecurity firm Cybele discovered at least 530,000 zoom accounts listed for sale on a dark web hacker forum for $0.0020 cents.</p>



<p>The data relating to students so exposed or improperly disclosed can cause significant harm to students where students may indulge in violating each other’s privacy like online gossip, cyberbullying, etc. Besides, it can also result in a misunderstanding between schools and parents, alumni, applicants, and others.</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy Risks</strong></h4>



<p>As personal information has become the subject of a digitized world, the risks of cyber attacks have increasingly posed a threat to data privacy. The data privacy risks have the tendency to cause a data breach when a cybercriminal infiltrates a data source and extracts confidential information. While most data breaches occur due to hacking or malware attacks other methods include accidental data sharing, employee data theft, internet fraud, etc.</p>



<p><strong>The most common data breaches occur due to the following risks:</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Accidental Data Sharing&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Personal data is usually exposed by cybercriminals however, sometimes the company’s own employees accidentally share and misplace consumer’s sensitive data resulting in the data breach. For example in 2018, hundreds of Australian’s personally identifiable information and health information we&#8217;re exposed to the public after an employee accidentally shared some sensitive data with an organizational outsider.</p>



<p><strong>• Employee Data Theft</strong></p>



<p>The data theft by a departing employee is a bigger threat than that of a hacker. It occurs most frequently when an employee leaves or resigns from an organization to work for a competitor or to set up their own rival company. For instance, Levandowski in 2019, stole diagrams and drawings related to simulations, radar technology, and Light Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), source code snippets, PDFs marked as confidential, Videos of test drives, and Marketing information from Google and provided it to Uber.</p>



<p><strong>Most commonly the data theft includes stealing of customer information, financial records, Email list, process document, employees records etc.</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;• Ransomware</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ransomware attacks have been becoming grave as the years pass by. Ransomware is the form of malware that encrypts the victim’s file. The attacker then demands the victim to restore access to data upon payment. In order to retrieve the basic data hostage and to restore affected data, most of the organizations agree to pay the ransom to the attackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;As witnessed in 2019, the ransomware attacks have vastly affected sectors like health care, manufacturing, finance, etc. As a response to this many companies has put forth ransomware prevention as a priority in 2020.</p>



<p><strong>• Bad Password Hygiene&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Account passwords should be such so that they are difficult to guess and harder to crack. An overwhelming number of passwords may lead to poor password hygiene when there is no technology in place to help.</p>



<p>Reusing and sharing of passwords has remained a common practice in most businesses among the employees resulting in countless data breaches and individual account takeovers.</p>



<p>The incidents leading to poor password hygiene may include selecting passwords that are obvious, selecting the same password for each account, temptation to share passwords with others for convenience, and writing down the passwords for easy recall, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Phishing Emails&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A phishing attack is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon to lure the victim with an attempt to obtain sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It manipulates the victims into performing certain actions like clicking on a malicious link or willfully disclosing the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>• Internet Frauds&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The main aim of internet fraud usually is to deceive the victim or to otherwise take advantage of them by stealing the information. such information can be used for financial gain by making fraudulent transactions, draining bank accounts, etc. which may result in significant reputational repercussions and increase the risk of class action lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>one of the oldest internet fraud examples is Nigerian Email scams. Someone from a country (often Nigeria, but not always) contacts you via email in broken English. They explain that a rich person they know has died and the money has nowhere to go; if you can help them get the funds out of the country, they’ll give you some as a reward</p>



<p>The most prominent internet frauds are online shopping frauds, email scams, identity theft, tax scams, lottery frauds, matrimonial frauds, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Bribery&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bribery mostly results in serious data security concern to those companies whose data and intellectual property is incredible of high value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though bribery not being the most convenient way to perpetuate data, however, the officials of a company can be bribed into revealing the company’s confidential data. In 2018, the employees of Amazon were accused of participating in a bribery scheme that compromises customer data, and a year later it was discovered that AT&amp;T employees received bribes to plant malware on the company’s network.</p>



<h4><strong>How important is Data Privacy?</strong></h4>



<p>Data is an incredibly important part of a company’s asset, collecting and sharing of data can be a big business in today’s digital world but for a business to safely and successfully take advantage of data they are collecting, they need to have safeguards in place to ensure that data is under tight lock and consumers are not subject to uninvited surveillance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this age of digital economy, true company value lies in the collected customer data which is an asset, worthy of being protected. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data created and stored continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Any information stored digitally needs to be properly protected right from financial information and payment details to contact information. Data protection is not only a legal necessity but crucial for protecting and maintaining the business also.</p>



<p>Data privacy importance lies in the fact that individuals are able to maintain their autonomy and individuality over how their personal information moves into the economy and society. The right to privacy is the fundamental right of an individual so he is at liberty to protect his data and regulate its use.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Data Privacy Tips</strong>:</p>



<p>While the new decade promised an unexplored revolution in the field of Information Technology which has blurred the lines between the real world and the virtual one, it becomes vital for people to be more concerned about their privacy. </p>



<p><strong>Some tips that may help to create a friendly environment for commerce, learning, and communication are listed as follows;</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Use a Safe Search Engine</strong></p>



<p>It’s possible that sometimes a person can be scammed easily by fake engines leading one to fake pages that look like true intended sites. So if one intends to search an online retailer, instead of searching him through the search engine, one should directly visit the secure https:// page or use the App launched by such retailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>•<strong> Use Two Factor Authentication</strong></p>



<p>Two-factor authentication is a higher level of security process than the single factor authentication method in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. It adds an extra layer of security by making the logins extra secure and difficult for hackers to hack sensitive information. It confirms the identity of a person by using two factors one is the password and the other is the security token or a biometric factor, such as fingerprint or facial scan.</p>



<p>• <strong>Anti-Virus Software&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The updated Anti-virus software program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware can better protect sensitive data from being hacked. It not only safeguards from malicious files and viruses but also helps to protect personal information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Digital Vault</strong></p>



<p>Digital Vault is an online vault that protects the information inside it by securing the data from all major risks over the network. It provides great help in securing all the necessary information like a credit card, social security, driving license, passport numbers, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Safe Wi-Fi Environment</strong></p>



<p>The public wifi is inherently less secure than that of the personal one because the number of connections is not known. One should always avail of the safest security protocol to avoid data theft or privacy issues while on public wifi. For this purpose, one can use a secure VPN that hides the IP address and encrypts the information over the web.</p>



<p>• <strong>Limited Information on Social Media</strong></p>



<p>For the protection of personal data, one should avoid personally identifiable information to be shared on social networking sites which could be later used as answers to security questions. The social media privacy settings should be updated to limit the information collected by different sites and who can see the information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Strong Passwords</strong></p>



<p>One should always create strong passwords by making use of capital letters, lowercase, numbers, special characters and change them often. The stronger the password, the more difficult a threat will be.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>How much are&nbsp;the Countries Concerned?</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1IP5XARUhpT-d-CjaXxDGVOB3hs1R1cuuMRuKqU7L_SCvYVdZ0daDj1IRFkOUcmAeUTB-lu3qY7B0MkFErI5Q17-pVrXWMLy9CMMoAky0bgpDf7FgM_VnstJgF7qFdFYI8umBXM6" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In order to address the data privacy issues like data theft, phishing email attacks, ransomware attacks, etc. almost every country around the Globe has enacted data privacy legislation under their municipal laws. These laws govern the rules and regulations for the collection, storage, and use of collected data in a legitimate manner. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the privacy laws around the world are as follows:</strong></p>



<p>1. <strong>CCPA</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act / USA&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Officially in effect on January 1st, 2020, this legislation demands the companies to inform the user of data processing, take extra measures to protect user information, and allow users a say in what data is collected and how it is shared.</p>



<p><strong>2. CALOPPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The California Online Privacy Protection Act/ USA.</strong></p>



<p>This Act requires commercial websites to post privacy policies detailing data collection and use on their website.</p>



<p><strong>3. CFAA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act/US.</strong></p>



<p>The law prohibits accessing the computer without authorization or excess of authorization in order to reduce the instances of malicious hacking.</p>



<p><strong>4. PIPEDA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act/Canada.</strong></p>



<p>This Act mandates that businesses using data for, or in the course of, commercial activities, must disclose the purpose of that data collection to the owners of that data, and obtain consent to proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. LGPD</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lei Geral de Protèçao de dados Pessoais/ Brazil.</strong></p>



<p>LGPD is landmark legislation outlining data processing standards, including the ten legal bases on which the data can be processed. While the law was modeled after the EU GDPR it is notably less strict.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>PDP</strong></p>



<p><strong>National Directorate of Personal Data Protection/ Argentina.</strong></p>



<p>This law replaced Argentina’s Personal Data Protection Law and it gave users for the first time in Argentina the right to request, the deletion, and transfer of data.</p>



<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>GDPR</strong></p>



<p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation/EU.</strong></p>



<p>It sets the strictest and most far-reaching standards for the handling of user data. It is based on the principles of consent, transparency, protection, and user control, and threatens fines as high as 4% of a company&#8217;s annual revenue.</p>



<p><strong>8. e-Privacy</strong></p>



<p><strong>e-Privacy Directive and Regulation/ EU.</strong></p>



<p>The ePrivacy Directive is often referred to as cookie law due to its requirement that websites obtain user consent to non-essential cookies before launching those cookies.</p>



<p><strong>9. BBSG</strong></p>

<p>This Law sets rigid standards under which businesses are required to adopt and maintain protective measures for data stored in IT systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>10. POPI</strong></p>



<p><strong>Protection Of Personal Information Act/South Africa.</strong></p>



<p>This Law applies to all South African organizations. It sets a standard of accountability for responsible data processing and establishes the requirement of customer consent to direct marketing outreach.</p>



<p><strong>11. Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018(India).</strong></p>



<p>After the Right to Privacy was determined as a Fundamental Human Right in 2017. India’s first Data Privacy Law was quickly created. The legislation sets privacy and data protection standards and notably introduces mandatory annual data audits.</p>



<p><strong>12. Cyber Security Law (china).</strong></p>



<p>China’s was enacted to increase data protection, data localization, and cybersecurity in the interest of national security.</p>



<p><strong>13. ECPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Electronic Communications Privacy Act/ US.</strong></p>



<p>It prohibits the third party from disclosing private electronic communication without authorization.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Data privacy has generated the attention of the individuals, sharing sensitive personally identifiable information due to the privacy breach incidents which are increasing as the technology is evolving. The collection, transfer, and dissemination of information which usually takes place via the internet, get exposed to a number of risks. For this reason, it generates the attention of the public, academics, government, and the business class which is valuable for the reason that would encourage concern to be shown to the past and future of privacy protection.</p>



<p>Privacy being a fundamental right is an element of a healthy democratic society and a social property which relates to power, culture, values, social standing, liberty, and dignity among other things.</p>



<p>In order to take the account of data privacy risks, though much legislation has been enacted to address these issues, however, there are still incidents of data privacy intrusions for which the countries need to come up with the effective implementation of those legislations. Since there is an alarming rise of data privacy risks leading to data thefts and data breaches, the Legislations alone won’t count so, it’s high time that the information technology industry and government come together to lay down and regulate the effective means and norms to curb the menace of intrusion of privacy.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong>:</h3>



<p> The unwavering conflict between Israel, the world&#8217;s only Jewish state, and Palestine, consisting of the Arab population, sparked up the most controversial and polarizing issues within modern-day international politics, essentially over the power dispute in deciding who gets what part of the geographical land.</p>



<p><strong>Palestine</strong> is located at the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea, to the west of Jordan and south of Lebanon, consisting of Jordan valley and Ghawr, mountains and hills, southern desert, coastal and inner plains, whereas Israel is located at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean sea in west Asia, In the south, it has a small coastal line on the Red sea. It is surrounded by Egypt from the southwest, Syria from the northeast, Lebanon from the north, and Jordan from the east. (Please consider the map for a clear idea).</p>



<p>The unresolved conflict between the two countries fighting for the right to attain peaceful statehood existence, within the same geographical region of the middle east, began in the early 20th century. But it can be dated back to thousands of years when the Jews fled from persecution in Europe wanting to establish a state of their own. Still, it was resisted by the Arabs who saw the land as rightfully as their own As a result of which several wars were fought, with the majority of wars being among those fought in the year 1948 and 1967. The war of 1967 is of great importance so far as the current situation is concerning because it transferred the west bank and Gaza strip under the control of Jews.</p>



<p>The continuous string of wars between the two parties has to lead to a situation very difficult to resolve. It was difficult to make the west bank, which was essentially a part of Palestine, occupied by the Israeli military in 1967 along with East Jerusalem and Gaza strip, a part of an independent Palestine, which was the first and the foremost demand of the Palestinians because Israel had built settlements and constructed barriers which formed a de-facto border, making it difficult to decide, which part of the Jerusalem shall belong to, as both sides claim it to be their center. The dispute between the two sides regarding refugees is yet another crucial issue that needs thorough introspection. Therefore, the central conflict is essential regarding the Holy land, which is of greater religious, cultural, and political importance to both the parties in the disagreement.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Holy Land</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&nbsp;The term holy land usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern state of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and of southwestern Syria. The city of Jerusalem is sacred to many religious traditions, including the Abrahamic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which consider it a holy city. Some of the most sacred places for each of these religions are found in Jerusalem, and the one shared between all three is the Temple Mount.</p>



<p>Jerusalem has been considered the holiest city in&nbsp;<strong>Judaism</strong>&nbsp;and the Jewish people&#8217;s ancestral and spiritual homeland since the 10th century BC. It is given such a special status in Jewish law that Jews outside Jerusalem pray facing its direction and believe that God promised the land to the children of Abraham i.e., Israelis and hence the claim.</p>



<p>So far as the&nbsp;<strong>Islamic</strong>&nbsp;stand is concerned, Jerusalem is the sacred site along with Mecca and Medina because it is believed that the previous prophets of Islam had a close affiliation with the city and even the last messenger of Islam, Prophet Mohammad (saw) visited the city on a nocturnal journey. Besides that, it is also regarded as the first qibla and hence holds a great significance for Muslims in general and the inhabitants of Palestine in particular.</p>



<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>



<p> The conflict between the two countries gathered gravity in 1917 when the official support of Britain was extended to the Jewish National home in Palestine by Arthur James Balfour, then British Foreign Secretary, whose support was seen as ignoring the rights of Arabs of Palestine, which ultimately led to violence. When Britain was not able to control the fuelling of the violence, it withdrew its forces from Palestine in 1948, the time when the United Nations was created. Hence the matter is now to be resolved by the United Nations itself by taking into consideration the rights and claims of both the parties in the conflict.</p>



<p>The United Nations took its first in an attempt to solve the problem by presenting a partition plan which proposed to create separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine. The plan was accepted by most of the Jews but rejected by Arabs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, When Israel declared its independence in 1948, a war took place between the two states the outcome of which was that Israel controlled about 50% of more territory than was suggested by the UN. Jordan controlled the west bank, Jerusalem holy sites, and Egypt controlled Gaza, but the Jews were removed from inside of Gaza by Israel in 2005; however, it maintained tight control at the border crossing.</p>



<p>Shortly after in the year 1967, another war took place between Arabs and Israeli, where Israel seized Golan Heights from Syria, the west bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza strip from Egypt. Currently, the west bank is nominally controlled by the Palestinian authority but is under Israeli occupation in the sense that the Israeli troops enforce security Restrictions and the Gaza strip is the control of Hamas, an Islamist fundamentalist party with no ground troop occupation.</p>



<p>The year 1975 proved to be significant for Palestinians as the UN in year 1975 gave observer status to the Palestine liberation organization (PLO)and recognized the<strong> Palestinians&#8217; right to self-determination</strong> but irrespective of this recognition, violence continued between the two which led to the formation of Hamas in 1987, which is an offshoot of Egypt&#8217;s Muslim brotherhood seeking to free Palestine by jihad. It was in this year only when the tension in occupied territories of the west bank and Gaza reached a crucial point which led to the first intifada i.e. a war between Palestinian militants and the Israeli army.</p>



<p>After the grave violence which led to the wastage of thousands of innocent lives on both sides, PLO and Israel agreed to recognize each other and renounced violence under an accord called Oslo Accords in 1993 which led to the establishment of the<strong> Palestinian Authority</strong> which later received autonomy in some parts of the west bank and the Gaza strip.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Current Situation</strong></h4>



<p>  After the gulf war against Kuwait, where Palestinians supported Iraq, Palestinians lost financial and military support from Arabs(Zahler Reuben Israel Palestinian conflict, Oregon Hillel Eugene OR20 Nov 2014 lecture). Still, since the international community has recognized the problem of a Palestinian refugee, western nations came forward for support.</p>



<p>As far as the negotiation is concerned, more rounds of negotiation occurred like the one led by then US president Bill Clinton which is the camp David ii, but this too didn&#8217;t fructify and was followed by intifada second, &#8220;the Al-Aqsa&#8221; intifada which erupted between the two parties in the year 2000 which left severe and deep imprints in the entire region. By 2003, 2,400 Palestinians and 800 Israelis have died, leaving hundreds more wounded and traumatized (Bunton martin p. the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a very short introduction Np,97 print).</p>



<p>The former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon sought to disrupt the Palestinian authority&#8217;s economic and physical infrastructure (ibid.) Israel deployed tanks, helicopters, and troops in Palestinian territories. The aim of Ariel Sharon, the then Prime Minister, was to separate the Israeli from Palestinians and not opt for any negotiations.</p>



<p>The largely tumultuous decade of the 2000s resulted in more radical threats and further insecurity, intense military retaliation, and continual hardship for a daily Palestinian. When we consider the Gaza strip&#8217;s violence, there occur semi-frequent conflicts like the 2008 Israel-Gaza war, 2012 conflict, and the war of 2014, which usually resulted in protests across <strong>the west bank, IDF bombings, and ground invasions in Gaza</strong>, among other violations.</p>



<p>The Israeli Govt. has taken a strict stand so far as its dealings with the Palestinians are concerned within the scope of international humanitarian law because it continues to impose unjustifiable restrictions on Palestinian human rights, not allowing the moment of goods and people in and out of Gaza strip and by allowing the Israeli citizens to settle in the occupied Gaza strip. Gaza&#8217;s restrictions resulted in <strong>limited access to educational institutions, medical care</strong>, economic and other opportunities, clean water, and electricity, and basic needs, which left 80% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid.</p>



<p>The international human rights standards continue to be violated at Israeli forces&#8217; hands by firing live ammunition at peaceful demonstrators in Gaza and open fire operations. According to Al-Mezan, a Palestinian rights group, Israeli forces <strong>killed 34 Palestinians</strong>, and <strong>1883 were injured </strong>with live ammunition during the protests in 2019 as per the Gaza health ministry. These violations also resulted in unlawful attacks and civil casualties on both sides.</p>



<p>According to Israeli Group Peace Now, in 2019, plans for 5995 housing units in west bank settlements were approved by Israeli authorities, excluding east Jerusalem as compared to 5618 in 2018.</p>



<p> Israel&#8217;s cabinet officials approved the ex-post-facto, the outpost settlement of Mevo&#8217;ot Yericho in the Jordan valley, something that is illegal even under Israeli law. Besides that,<strong> the Israeli authorities also destroyed 504 Palestinian homes</strong> and other structures, while they with no construction permit in East Jerusalem or the West bank have given it under their control.</p>



<p><strong>According to the UN office of the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the demolitions displaced 642 people.</strong></p>



<p>Israel responds to the launching of rockets or incendiary balloons from Gaza, resulting in civilians&#8217; casualties by restricting Gaza&#8217;s access to territorial waters for fishers, closing Israel crossings to Gaza, slashing fuel imports to the Gaza power plant as a punishment.</p>



<h4><strong>Stand of the International Community</strong></h4>



<p>As far as the international community is concerned, different countries are being shown regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue.<strong> The US has recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights</strong>, which imposed and expanded aid cuts to the west bank and Gaza including the USAID projects, declaring that the US does not consider the Israeli settlements to violate international humanitarian law. The US states also penalized the global tourism company Airbnb under anti-boycott laws for its pledge to remove listings from Israeli settlements in the west bank from its website, and hence it reversed its pledge.</p>



<p>The European Union criticized the demolition in Sur Baher, Jerusalem, and the Israelis politician Netanyahu&#8217;s promise to annex the Jordan valley.</p>



<p>Even the prosecutor of the international criminal court, instead of commencing a probe into the Palestinian situation, requested the court&#8217;s ruling about the matter that Palestine is a state, for the jurisdiction of the concerned court concerning the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>



<p>In Feb. 2020, <strong>US President Donald Trump announced a controversial peace plan</strong> for the region that would legalize Israeli settlements in the west bank and East Jerusalem, allowing annexation of the parts of the west bank while Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel.</p>



<p>This proposal was rejected by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on the basis that this plan will not bring peace or stability to the region as it annuls the legitimacy of Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination. He said that it is an Israeli- American plan to put an end to Palestine&#8217;s question. But the Israeli ambassador Danny Danon considered this approach as a sane plan to end the longstanding conflict.</p>



<p>The US envoy Mr. Mladenov expressed hope that the ambassador will support the Secretary General&#8217;s call for negotiation for the conflict&#8217;s solution. He held that &#8220;in the absence of the credible path back to negotiations, we all face a heightened <strong>risk of violence</strong>. Violence, which will drag both peoples and the region to a spiral of escalation with no end in sight&#8221;.</p>



<p> As far as the world&#8217;s stand, with regard to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, is concerned, the bitter truth is the <strong>legitimacy of Israel</strong> is recognized by the non-Muslim countries who maintain diplomatic relations with it. But some of them have taken an unbiased stand and have criticized the Israelis treatment of the Palestinians and its occupation of the west bank.</p>



<p>&nbsp;When we look at the global public opinion, we realize that it is more sympathetic to Palestine, which has created a concern among the Israelis that the international boycott moment called BDS could pick up some support. This moment, which was initiated in 2005, aims to capitalize on Israel&#8217;s international anger by creating costs to Israel Palestinian policy through (BDS), i.e. boycotting Israeli goods and institutions, divestment from Israeli companies, and sanctions on the nation itself. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drags on, many Israelis worry that BDS will become more mainstream. It is believed that BDS could be a real problem for Israel if it fails to come to terms with Palestinians.</p>



<p>One of the crucial things that have become the <strong>cause of Israel&#8217;s poor global standing</strong> <strong>is the west bank</strong> because most countries believe that the continuous Israeli occupation of the west bank is an unlawful military occupation which violates the fourth Geneva convention (reference) which is justified by Israel by stating that it isn&#8217;t occupied. Even if it were, it doesn&#8217;t violate the fourth Geneva convention because it prohibits forcible population transfers, not a voluntary settlement. </p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Mahatma Gandhi, one of the peace-loving politicians of the Indian Nation has said &#8220;I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary. The evil it does is permanent &#8220;and when we consider this saying concerning the crises in any part of the world be it Syria, Rohingya, Palestine, Kashmir or any other conflicted area, one common thing is that it gets reflected on the eye of our mind, no matter how long-term the violence might be, its desired outcome never fructifies simply because power is violence and the more one tries to suppress a just cause illegally, the more such reasons will flourish. Therefore, parties to the conflict should realize this simple principle before it&#8217;s too late and should try to recognize each other in a rightful and fairway. As far as the Palestine-Israel is concerned, keeping in view of the unending devastation and grave violations of fundamental human rights, it&#8217;s high time for both of the parties to say no to violence, which is not going to be fruitful to any one of them instead of trying to resolve the issue more amicably and peacefully considering the emotional aspect and rights of both the sides. Besides, it is also vital for the International community to take an unbiased stand and contribute to the dispute&#8217;s just and fair settlement. Meanwhile, the UN is highly duty-bound to perform the function for which it was created and stop being a diplomatic, mute spectator, thereby contributing to global peace and security.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Every welfare state is duty-bound to come to the rescue of an oppressed class by the enactment of social welfare legislation or legislations aiming at positive discrimination. During ancient times, the laws in the place were not sufficient enough to fully protect the rights and interests of women folk. However, with the advancement of Society, this gender was also recognized and accepted as equally important, and for their protection, various laws were enacted but soon were those welfare legislations misused by some chronic and wicked accusers who impose allegations on some innocent persons for material, emotional or social gains.<br>Such laws aiming at maintaining balance and equality in society may be misused by any person against any other person. However, most of the cases of such nature are filed by a woman against a man, but that does not mean, allegations are not levied against a woman under the grab of protection provided by such laws.</p>



<h4>Impact of a False Accusation of Sexual Violence</h4>



<p>The issue of the intensity of false accusation and allegations of sexual assault may be regarded as the major controversial dispute which affects the phenomenon of retaliation for violence against women. On account of the presumption of Law, every Accused is deemed to be innocent until the offense is proved against him. Still, the reaction of society in such cases is that, without giving heed to the legal process of providing the offense and having faith in the Judicial system, people start victimizing such person and treat him with hatred and humiliation which unfortunately makes his mixing in the society difficult, affects his employment his personal life and hence hurdles his rehabilitation.<br>The result of this accusation is that it has got a tremendous devastating and destructive impact on the Accused even when the allegations do not lead to criminal sanctions vitally because once the person is accused of this offense, he is deemed to be convicted even before his guilt is proved in the court of law.</p>



<h4>Role of Media</h4>



<p>Media plays an important role whenever someone is accused of any sexual violence-related case, which ultimately worsens the trauma and humiliation. Media has the potential to highlight any issue and to circulate it in such a way that the person(s) involved in such case becomes known to everyone and when the person so involved is accused of an offense, it puts his/her emotional, mental, physical wellbeing at stake within no time.<br>Whenever any person is accused of any such offense, the media Uses its potential to put the accused in a non-judicial trial by circulating his pictures and amplifies the audacity of the problem meanwhile without considering its pros and cons as a result of which it becomes very difficult for him to re-establish his damaged reputation.<br>For this reason, mainly, most of the accusations are falsely levied so that the Accuser may on one side, attain attention, publication, or any other material gains, and on another side, the Accused may be humiliated and that he/she may suffer losses of whatever nature.</p>



<h4>Causes of False Accusations</h4>



<p>False accusation of sexual violence is reporting of the offense of sexual violence when no violence has taken place, the causes of false accusation fall broadly into two main categories;<br><strong>False memories:</strong> Which may occur because of and is not limited to, recovered memory therapy, memory conformity, and victims confusion; or,<br><strong>Lies:</strong> The person claiming to be a victim may implicate any person alleged of an offense into a false accusation of sexual violence to satisfy her personal grudges and may have several other motivations for such allegations.<br>An accuser may have the following motivations behind such false allegations;<br>• <strong>Revenge: </strong>The accuser may do so with the aim to damage the reputation, finances, and freedom of the alleged accused.<br>• <strong>Material gain:</strong> It may be done with the aim of obtaining material benefits, professional Promotion or to receive money.<br>•<strong> Attention:</strong> The Accuser may sometimes do so with the aim of receiving the attention of any kind.<br><strong>• Producing an alibi:</strong> This allegation may sometimes be used to cover up any other behavior like being late or absent to an appointment.<br>• <strong>Sympathy:</strong> It may be done by the Accuser for the purpose of seeking a special kind of attention to improve a personal relationship with an individual.<br>•<strong> Relabeling:</strong> Sometimes the consensual sex is relabeled as Rape either because of family pressure or because of its shameful character and hence the false complaint.<br>• <strong>Regret: </strong>It may so happen that sometimes after consensual sex, because of shame or negative feelings, the Accuser either willfully or because of the pressure of others may file a complaint against the alleged Accused.</p>



<h4>Scenario in Asia</h4>



<p>The problem of a false accusation of sexual violence is prevalent everywhere but considering Asia, it can be said that the feminist or #MeToo moment has tremendously gathered gravity and has been misused in such a manner that men usually avoid mixing with women for fear of false accusations.<br>In Asian countries, marriage is considered pious and is usually related to religion. However, weddings are another social aspect of such allegations. First, the allegations hit the domestic life of a person, his/her spouse is the worst affected and the relationship takes a severe beating Like, With the rise of Feminism in China, the #Metoo moment gathered importance but this moment was soon misused by the Accusers. The first #Metoo case in China, which may be regarded as one of the most important cases in Chinese history was that of Ms. Wang, who accused her former boss of sexually harassing her. But the outcome of this trial was that, in the end, it was Ms. Wang who was required to defend herself.</p>



<p>Though the stringent laws have been enacted so as to prevent crime against women but a dishonorable trend of filing false cases is prevalent in Asia, rendering the laws dealing with the protection of women and aiming at gender justice as a tool of manipulation. Hence the definition of Feminism has, in fact, become fascism.<br>The devastating impact of this new trend of false accusations is that it weakens the legitimate object of Feminism. The women who file false and frivolous cases get the support of such groups who actually help the women genuinely victimized. Since it’s usually a woman who files such a false and frivolous case against a woman or a man and thereby compromises the object of achieving the equality and mutual comprehension between genders, sought to be achieved by such groups and hence it delegitimizes the efforts of Feminism altogether.<br>For instance, shocking statistics have been presented by the Delhi Commission of women which shows that 53.2% of the rape cases between 2013 to 2014 in Delhi were false. The fact that the cases so filed with the police authorities are half true and half false brings into light the fact that the rectification of the society has materialized changes in that aspect.</p>



<h4>Current Situation</h4>



<p>The innocent Accused are gaining some consciousness and becoming somewhat aware of the possible way outs and hence we can see few cases of defamation against accusers or those involved in their humiliation, however, the idea of defamation lawsuits is yet to be discovered fully as there is very less awareness about it and even if some people are aware of it, they dare not to file such lawsuits for fear of tough procedure of proving one&#8217;s innocence in such cases.<br>Hence, it can be said that though there are accusers ready to misuse the feminist moment, #Metoo moment, or any other moment that actually aims at bringing about gender equality, the innocent accused persons are gathering the courage to challenge such allegations and prove the truth.</p>



<h4><strong>Scheme of Law</strong></h4>



<p>When we look at the laws and the punishments related to sexual offenses, we realize that very strict law has been kept in place and very stringent punishment provided for the same but while framing those laws, no regard has been given to the fact that if such a law gets misused what will be the way out.<br>No direct law dealing with the offense of false accusation of sexual violence has been passed by any country in Asia but the shield can be taken under the umbrella of provisions dealing with defamation.<br>For instance, the Defamation law in India which provides a remedy to the innocent Accusers runs as follows:<br>In case of filing any false complaint or presentation of false evidence so as to prosecute an innocent person or if any such intention exists<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Following charges can be framed against the Accuser in India under Indian Penal Code:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Section182: False information with the intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person;</strong><br>Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant-<br>(a)To do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or<br>(b)To use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, Shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term Which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.</p>

<p><strong>Section192: Fabricating false evidence.<br></strong>Whoever causes any circumstance to exist or makes any false entry in<br>Any book or record, or makes any document containing a false statement, Intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by Law before a public servant as such, or before an arbitrator and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding, is said: “to fabricate false evidence”.</p>



<p><strong>Section193: Punishment for false evidence</strong>.<br>Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and Shall also be liable to fine, and whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>

<p><strong>Section196: Using evidence known to be false.</strong><br>Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true or genuine evidence<br>Any evidence which he knows to be false or fabricated shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave or fabricated false evidence.</p>



<p><strong>Section199: False statement made in declaration which is by law receivable as evidence.</strong><br>Whoever, in any declaration made or subscribed by him, which Declaration any Court of Justice, or any public servant or another person, is bound or authorized by law to receive as evidence of any fact, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, touching any point material to the Object for which the declaration is made or used, shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave false evidence.</p>



<p><strong>Section200: Using as true such declaration knowing it to be false.</strong><br>Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true any such declaration, knowing the same to be false in any material point, shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave false evidence.</p>

<p>And if such criminal proceeding be instituted on a false charge of an<br>An offense punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>



<p><strong>Section 340 of Code of Criminal Procedure,</strong> The law states that there are two conditions subject to which a complaint can be filed against a person who has given false affidavit or false evidence in a Proceeding before a court.<br>Firstly, the person has given a false affidavit in a Proceeding before the court and,<br>Secondly, in the opinion of the court, it is expedient in the interest of justice to make, an inquiry against such a person in relation to the offense committed by him.<br>Furthermore, a notice is issued to certain police officers under this section for an inquiry to determine if false evidence was fabricating records and Putting up a false case. Besides, the person may also be charged with the civil liability of wasting the time of police.</p>



<p>Likewise, the law directly dealing with false accusations of sexual violence has not yet been enacted in China and the remedies are sought under the Defamation Laws. However, the Chinese defamation law is not specifically spelled out as such but has been developed from Articles 101 and 102 of the General Principles of the Civil Law (enacted in 1987), and several subsequent supporting documents: the Supreme People’s Court’s Answers to Certain Issues Concerning Trials of Cases Involving the Right to Reputation (released in 1993), Understanding and Application of the 1993 Answers, Interpretation of Certain Issues Concerning Trials of Cases Involving the Right to Reputation (released in 1998), and Understanding and Application of the 1998 Interpretation.</p>



<p><strong>As explained in the 1993 Answers, defamation exists if</strong><br>i. The defendant has committed an illegal act,<br>ii. The plaintiff’s reputation has been damaged, and<br>iii. The illegal act caused damage.</p>



<p><strong>Such defamation exists in three circumstances:</strong></p>



<p>• Written or oral insults or libel that damages a person’s reputation;<br>• Unauthorized disclosure of personal information that damages a person’s reputation; or<br>• A news report containing “gross error” that damages a person’s reputation.</p>



<p>In Understanding and Application of the 1993 Answers, the SPC clarified that truth was NOT a defense to defamation. If a work insults and damages a person’s reputation, it is defamatory regardless of whether it is true.</p>



<p>The 1993 Answers state that either the allegedly defamed person or their close relatives (defined as spouses, parents, children, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren) have standing to sue. That rules out almost anyone alive from 1950 onward as a character that can is included without fears of liability.</p>



<p>Similar is the case with other Asian countries where Defamation laws are resorted to in case of false accusations of sexual violence. Hence it can be said that there is a dire need for the Asian countries to come forward and enact direct laws in order to fully protect the basic human rights of wronged persons.</p>



<h4>Modus Operandi</h4>



<p>Be it a man or woman, dignity is something which is precious to everybody and if a person falsely accuses another person of any sexual offense, his victimization is going to prove humungous. Usually, the responses to alleged sexual offenses become erroneous in the absence of witnesses when the court has to rely entirely on the statement of the complainant and corroborative forensic evidence which Is largely impacted by the prevailing cultural discourse and preconceptions about sexual predators and their victims.<br>Furthermore, the value to be attributed to the statement of alleged Accused will be lesser than the value and importance attributed to the statement of the supposed victim even in cases where the evidence only consists of testimony from the alleged victim and is strongly rebutted by the alleged perpetrator, the moral imperative not to let down another victim or to leave a possible sex offender free to cause further harm may be compelling (Webster, 1998; 2005). Though evidence and conduct do provide a light on the correct state of affairs the problem arises when the act that was initially consensual but was purported to be non-consensual.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>When we look back at history, we see every possible reason for the enactment of such laws that provide for positive discrimination and for the emergence of the movements like feminism, the #MeToo movement, the formation of women’s commission, and the like.<br>But by and by not only does a woman misused this law against a man but there are some cases where it has also been misused against a woman and hence this is the law that has been used for gross violation of the basic human rights in general and the right to dignity, life, health and prosperity in particular.</p>



<p>Laws which are there, for easy access to women can easily be misused, for some of the notorious women do not resist the temptation of teaching a lesson to the male members for some personal motives and hence file false and frivolous cases against a man and the same trend is observed in anti-dowry law which is being misused to such an extent that it has been termed as legal terrorism.<br>There are a plethora of cases where men are falsely implicated under women-centric laws which lead to public humiliation, torture, and extortion, and what magnifies this suffering is the delayed proceedings.<br>Therefore, there is a dire need for speedier remedies in such cases with the system of checks and balances to be introduced so as to prevent misuse of such laws and this is the right time for the government of all the countries to introduce suitable amendments to such laws so as to prevent its misuse and safeguard the rights and interest of innocent accused persons. Hence need for the hour is to have such a balanced system where women are protected and men are not unnecessarily harassed.</p>
