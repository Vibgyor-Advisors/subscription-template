<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;The U.S relations with Mexico could be regarded as indispensable because of the fact that the countries share land and maritime border in North America. Several treaties have been concluded between the two nations such as the Gadsden Purchase (an agreement between the U.S and Mexico, in which the U.S agreed to pay Mexico $10million for a 2, 09,670 square mile portion of Mexico) and the <strong>North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA)</strong> (an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico and U.S, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America). Both are members of the various international organizations including the organization of the American States and the United Nations.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that both countries have close diplomatic, economic, and socio-cultural relations, illegal immigration and illegal trade in drugs and firearms continue to be the causes of differences between the two countries.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin</strong></h4>



<p>The first border dispute between The United States and Mexico arose because of the reason for migration. In an effort to control the inflow of English-speaking settlers, Mexico banned immigration to Texas from The United States. With the independence of Texas from Mexico in 1845, it became a part of The United States as a slave state by the efforts of the then Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. As a result of the independence of Texas, Mexico ended up its diplomatic relations with the United States.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in a fix to make the Rio Grande River the border between The United States and Mexico which would make Texas part of The United States, the then U.S President James Polk in 1845 offered to purchase California and New Mexico from the Mexican government which in turn was refused. As a mark of retaliation to the refusal, Polk sent military forces to the Rio Grande, and a full-scale US invasion followed with the seizure of Mexico City.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the peace treaty of <strong>Guadalupe</strong> <strong>Hidalgo</strong> was signed ending the Mexican-American war which obligated Mexico to relinquish present-day Arizona, California, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and Nevada. In return for the war-related damage to the Mexican land, $15 million in compensation was paid by The U.S. In addition to this, the peace treaty also provided for the protection of the property and civil rights of the roughly 80,000 Mexican nationals living in The U.S.</p>



<p>In 1853, the then U.S President Franklin Pierce planned to construct a railroad to the Pacific ocean for which he purchased 30,000 square miles of land along the Mesilla Valley which runs from California to El Paso for $10 million. The Gadsden Purchase marks the last adjustment to the border between Mexico and The United States and also the resolution for an indispensable border dispute between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;Cross Border Issues</strong></h4>



<p>The U.S- Mexican relations have usually remained friendly, nevertheless, periodic tensions have emerged over some major as well as minor issues including trade disputes, immigration, border security issues, drug trafficking, border environmental issues, and water resource issues respectively.</p>



<h4>Drug Trafficking&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Drug trafficking is a global illicit trade involving the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of substances that are subject to drug prohibition laws.</p>



<p>Mexico plays a major role in the US drug control policy as it is the primary source of and transit country for illicit drugs like heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine, fentanyl. Besides, Mexico is also a major transit country for cocaine produced in the Andean region of South America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fWZTs8sSSUU2-1TpfTHRNLiQgJ_ZIUUfln5lgpzVGnslhPx6BV8VKhXnQFaCy3AvoI5-J9Y2W2WcJXKDY7pTznmMPIzQTAxjeO8VI4n2ahrMpX3iAiQNc1YgwffUQkDrDuDvQ6j3" alt=""/></figure>



<p>According to the Drug Enforcement administration (it is an agency tasked with combating drug trafficking and distribution within the United States) 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican drug trafficking organisations which are involved in<strong> drug trafficking</strong>,<strong> money laundering</strong>, and other violent crime continue to pose a greatest criminal threat to the United States.</p>



<p>In 1969, an aggressive search and seizure counternarcotics operation was launched on the U.S Mexico border, by the then U.S President Richard Nixon while declaring “war on drugs”. The government of the United States deployed the agents for the purpose of inspecting all the persons and vehicles crossing into The United States through the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GNUFpZZZsUCtSY6OIrEx9IwZ6h9SzjE9E_oWL63fWjzN1cYNkWRNZt0c3ITEzNKDL3WnYFBw4wABrQSgQBQmB5LFJrfdzjHHrp43jDdPojPIYW-UC5HZxRdVJOoA-kbVsVG3qzbV" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The United States created the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA and there was some counternarcotics cooperation in the 1970s and 80s. However, the killing of one of its DEA agents in Mexico sparked outrage in The United States which led them to pursue the <strong>unilateral strategy to fight the war on drugs</strong>.</p>



<p>Data on drug seizures at the U.S. border indicate an alarming volume of trafficking taking place in recent years. Since 2009, heroin seizures at the southwestern border have almost tripled, while meth seizures quintupled. However, cocaine and marijuana remain two of the most commonly seized drugs along the southern borders, equating to millions of pounds seized by the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>



<p>Since 2012, the number of traffickers apprehended at U.S. borders has steadily increased from 364,768 to nearly 500,000 in 2014. From 2012 to 2015 the U.S. Border Patrol has seized more than:</p>



<p><strong>8.2 million lbs. of marijuana</strong></p>



<p><strong>32,600 lbs. of cocaine</strong></p>



<p><strong>34,000 ounces of heroin</strong></p>



<p><strong>17,600 lbs. of methamphetamine</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7TMDOoQh6GGd4LUJZPZf3gxZd4Ui6buMH1gGfjYaeVQGcN1Nc2qtz6aBDH1wMHcAYGeV8U3GVWjMtH39bH-UVVF6pvE36zOo_De9MboaXTYWgBLRzOUuw0nzAhL1edEb3fXixs9n" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, despite the high volume of search &amp; seizure programs that have effectively stopped millions of pounds of illicit drugs from entering the&nbsp; U.S,&nbsp; drugs are still finding their way across and have a profound impact in many states along southern and coastal borders.</p>



<h4><strong>Unauthorised Immigration&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Unauthorized immigration refers to the migration of people into a country in violation of the immigration laws of that country or the continued residence of people without the legal right to live in that country.</p>



<p>Unauthorized immigration has always been a subject of greater concern between The US and Mexico with much emphasis on how to prevent unauthorized migration and address the large population of illegal migrants living in the United States. Mexico being the largest source of unauthorized migrants in The United States, the U.S migration policies including stepped-up border and interior enforcement have primarily affected Mexicans as more Mexicans have been leaving the United States than arriving. However, the Mexicans living in the United States, including those who are unauthorized remain the top priority of the Mexican government.&nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="497" height="289" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R1S_Xr_TH953RI-AZtFngmkrIRYvb5xzwp3IQsr2DaTOI-DGjyHUUGdxGQl6dZZwXTEB2L94uXW2iHu6oeLxv2cKTfG8MWpbIrYs751Aqu4KhGSVH6s4h2eQO19q-xNJyjI8eY8l"></p>



<p><em>Undocumented Guatemalans carry their belongings after crossing the Guatemala-Mexico border</em></p>



<p>While the concern of the US government over unauthorized immigration was on peak in the 1990s, it came up with the strategy for tracking down the unauthorized immigrants living in the&nbsp; United States including the enforcement plan increasing border security and granting power to local law enforcement in the Border States to uphold immigration laws.</p>



<p>Since the mid-2000, successive Mexican governments have supported efforts to enact the Immigration reform in the United States, while being careful not to appear infringing upon US authority to make and enforce immigration laws. Mexico has made efforts to combat transmigration by unauthorized migrants and worked with US law enforcement to combat alien smuggling and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eYSimq8twEwPJCU6EMBiyVTVKEwRN4Vn6FQtI-t0UOD5mlXrwG1HdZblO2zsMeACeCuY3M5K1y3Abnt5pNBQGnOdXcr_Go2rM-XQvsM1c1ugzsLPGbmD7haEAuj4jPVvl9HfOaZu" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>NAFTA and USMCA</strong></h4>



<p>In 1980, the then US President Ronal Reagan put forth the idea of the <strong>North American Free Trade </strong>Zone as a part of his presidential campaign. After signing the Canada-United States free trade agreement in 1988, the governments of the US, Mexico, and Canada agreed to negotiate on what became NAFTA but even after ratification of the agreement by their respective capitals, NAFTA faced significant opposition in both US and Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQ-1CaWpYLLpg4JHSeR1uYIdH0bAX3idFKX081cB76qDQVhHMsMMZqjKt_cpA8VAS-ZCvFQU0sAmREweX5zhl1EcfAfylM90o0MMH-RAW3ohUS7fTmRYAoibo47Yi8AkedV-O2Br" alt="" width="595" height="429"/></figure>



<p>Eventually, all the three countries ratified NAFTA in 1993, and finally, it came into force a year later, after the addition of the two side agreements to it, The North American Agreement on Labor cooperation NAALC (it is the side agreement to NAFTA under which each of the three countries that are parties to NAFTA agreed to enforce their own labor standards and to strive to improve labor standards in their country) and The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation NAAEC (it is an environmental agreement between the US Canada and Mexico as a&nbsp; side treaty to NAFTA which sets out objectives concerning the conservation and the protection of the environment as well as concrete measures to further cooperation on the matters between the three countries).</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of NAFTA:</strong></h4>



<p>•<strong> NAFTA</strong> <strong>eliminated barriers to trade and investment</strong> between the US, Canada, and Mexico.</p>



<p>• It <strong>eliminated most tariffs</strong> with the major focus on liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobile manufacturing.</p>



<p>• The agreement also sought to protect intellectual property, establish dispute resolution mechanisms and through side agreements, implement labor and environmental safeguards.</p>



<p>• NAFTA fundamentally<strong> proved beneficial to North American economies </strong>and the average citizens but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.</p>



<p>On the other hand, critics of the agreement argue that it was to be blamed for job losses, wage stagnation driven by low wage competition, and a widening trade deficit.</p>



<p>After US President Donald Trump took office in 2017, all the three signatories a year later reached an agreement to modernize the 25-year-old NAFTA with the <strong>United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)</strong> and all the three countries had ratified it in 2020. The USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020, replacing NAFTA. The new United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and strong economic growth.</p>



<h4>Cross Border Environmental Issues&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Environmental health and environmental quality issues along the US-Mexico border have always been a concern for several years. Transboundary and shared resources and conflict include the flow of raw sewage and industrial wastewater into the United States from Mexico which has caused health and environmental problems in the border region.</p>



<p>Wastewater collection and treatment system capacity has not kept pace with rapid population growth in the border region. Also, the aging of existing wastewater infrastructure has resulted in increased maintenance issues such as pipeline ruptures. To address border sanitation issues, International Boundary and Water Commission <strong>(IBWC)</strong>, The US Environmental Protection Agency <strong>(EPA)</strong>, and the North American Development Bank<strong> (NADB)</strong> have been engaged to construct wastewater infrastructure on both sides of the border.</p>



<h4><strong>Recent Development and Crisis</strong></h4>



<p>Since the beginning of Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign, U.S-Mexico relations have been in crisis. The bilateral relationships between the two countries have been seriously affected by Trump’s criticism of Mexico and its people, his threats to deport millions of undocumented Mexicans, his desire to build what he calls a <strong>“beautiful wall”</strong> on the southern border, and his express intention to abandon NAFTA. For Mexico officials and intellectuals, the current state of affairs has reached the lowest point in the two countries&#8217; relationship over the last 25 years.</p>



<p><strong>President Trump refocused the Merida initiative</strong> through executive orders on combating transnational criminal organizations and enhancing border security. Though Trump has praised Mexico’s enhanced efforts to reduce migration flows but criticized Mexico’s anti-drug performance. On the proposal of the Mexican government in 2019, a high-level security working group, with a view to combating organized crime and cross-border crime, was agreed to be created by the U.S government which includes the Merida initiative as one aspect of bilateral efforts.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">&nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="446" height="255" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UGZoOgorhfNXsWf39fCBNdvXsxhU-ihZjcthXZtUchl4zENe6dIs115Q8--BEfVhmZNjOVPLS5gotxrsHxZafzAwnBImoMtnIj5p0f6FwASBZVcGKenKU96ViWXf8Brkt5kbnJ-J"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trump&#8217;s         <em>Border Wall</em></p>



<p>Throughout Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, he called for the construction of a bigger, more impenetrable border wall with a view to preventing illegal immigration from Mexico along the U.S-Mexico border. In furtherance of this proposal, The Trump administration two years later announced new rules to deny asylum to anyone crossing the United States illegally. However, Mexico has substantially opposed the construction of the border wall as well as the Trump administration&#8217;s immigration policy for the reason that Mexico places high importance on immigration, not only because millions of co-nationals live in the U.S but also because they send millions of dollars to the country.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SeSq-AGPSV8eXwvB4bGAqsPTzj7oaHOyO8QjusUDyvyutk118CrOh2fk0Zex6RsR9iSqxMwGAXOA3C7g_1Z-i-I_sg7T2nApTjytvkZiQMC59X4fznIZ6C6fGgzWuYndV83x44V-" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>For the first time over the last 25 years, the U.S-Mexico relations have withered away. The structural system that has prevailed for more than two decades is now under considerable threat. Although USMCA succeeded in the 25 years old NAFTA its future at present remains unpredictable. The nature of the bilateral relationship is likely to change substantially if the U.S implements its immigration reform which will have an enduring impact on the economies of both countries.</p>



<p>The U.S government’s immigration reforms and the modification in NAFTA have adversely affected Mexican nationalism and the perception of the U.S. Thus, the consequence of Trump’s campaign and his presidency has lead to the collapse of the bilateral relations between the two countries on one hand and strengthened the unity of Mexico’s citizens against the US Foreign policy on the other hand.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Data privacy is of greater importance in a world with ever-growing mountains of big data. During the earlier times, the consumers used to share their personal information or data via the offline platform where the chances of data privacy risks were minimal, however, with the growing technology, the consumers in this digital age share their vital information on the online platform, be it on social media sites, E-commerce sites and other Apps to perform certain kind of actions.</p>



<p>The concept of data privacy in this modern era is usually applied to critical personal information also known as Personally Identifiable Information. Such information is used for the purpose of identification of any person like the driver’s license number, bank account number, passport number, etc. and Personal Health Information in a medical record used for the identification of any person which was disclosed, created, or used in the course of providing a health care service. Of late with such a sensitive and personal data record, it becomes challenging when it attempts to use the data while protecting an individual’s personally identifiable information and privacy preferences.</p>



<h4><strong>Digitization of Services</strong></h4>



<p>While the consumers are sharing personal data on online platforms that collect growing amounts of information on the one hand, they have started visualising the danger in such data collection on the other hand. Data privacy has become more important in this digitalized world and those platforms collecting the vital information of an individual should be highly concerned with their data privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy </strong></h4>



<p>Primarily, privacy is the Right of a citizen of being free from public scrutiny or from having one’s personal information shared. Data Privacy is the right of the citizen to have control over how one’s personal information is collected and used. It deals with the practices which ensure that the data so shared by any person must be used for its intended purpose.</p>



<p>Most of the time, Data privacy is confused with Data security and is used interchangeably however, data privacy and data security are, by no means, the same terms.</p>



<p>Like, if you are using a Google Gmail account, your password would be a method of data security, while the way Google uses your data to administer your account would be data privacy.</p>



<p>Data security is a prerequisite to Data privacy therefore it is possible to have healthy security stand without addressing data privacy. However, it is not possible to ensure Data privacy without a solid security stand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9_wUOi_faXhF9sufm5ODOzjOZBL78uxrSF56tH3SnvEo1NNdhQSRxxBfZ0J7AXe6a36ita6XiIk0zWP_Aq8mqZHhDWwKjpJYaVX7CZuozQ0f4mX7qtST0bbCSJF1V-S8i-RKP5J1" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy and Data Security</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2KHHHno84GIoPLml6egdIRtC3qUwPZSL9bAKfZaUI1VWU8IUNmof27Admq_NK2yVjxZIS5V95hg2b2ptpcoDxvZ5M5ZubUSfsGNUFk6iWz8uzI2TAcx6drqZDb3ER5cDDYjETP8g" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy a Real Major Concern</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In this age of digitization, personal data influences a lot of our activities. It affects nearly everything including from what content or messages we see on the internet to so many decisions made whether it’s about a job, a license, or a loan and thereby sway almost every aspect of our lives. Since the autonomy and control over our lives are one of the hallmarks of freedom which would be rendered useless if the important decisions about our lives are being made without our participation which might turn out to be one of the reasons which give rise to data privacy concerns.</p>



<p><strong>Various types of personal information that often come under privacy concerns may be listed as follows;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Financial Information</strong></h4>



<p>Any financial information which is shared online or offline is sensitive as it can be used maliciously by someone to commit fraud. In 2019, First American Financial Corp. had 885 million records exposed online including bank transactions, social security numbers, and more.</p>



<p>Data about an individual’s financial transaction like the positions held in stocks and funds, outstanding debts, amount of assets, and purchases is usually sensitive. The person concerned could be the victim of identity theft or fraud if the criminals get access to such information. Similarly, data about a person’s purchases can reveal a great lot of information like the medications used, places visited, contacts, activities, or habits. This data may also be used by the corporations for the purpose of targeting the individual concerned with marketing customized towards the personal preferences of those individuals which the person concerned may or may not approve.</p>



<h4><strong>Internet Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In the modern era, where most of the information is shared online be it on social networking sites or other Apps, people experience growing concern about privacy challenges. With the use of various search engines and data mining, it has become possible to collect and combine information from a wide variety of sources very easily.</p>



<p><strong>For instance the Aadhaar Data Breach:</strong></p>



<p> In 2018 there was a massive breach In India allowing access to private information of Aadhaar holders, exposing their names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and their bank details along with the photographs, thumbprints, retina scans, and other identifying details of nearly 1.1 billion citizens.</p>



<p>One of the most worrisome issues of today’s world is the ability of a third person to control the information one reveals over the internet and who can access that information, whether Email can be read or stored by third parties without consent if websites one visited can collect, store and possibly share the personal information, whether third parties can track the websites that someone visited, etc.</p>



<h4><strong>Locational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Locational Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Locational data is the most sensitive data being collected by tracking capabilities of mobile devices which have the potential to strip away locational privacy from individuals, making it possible to intrude into the lives of others by consulting location databases. In 2017, McDelivery leak disclosed home addresses and even exact coordinates of 2.2 million users.</p>



<p>By tracking the locational information, potentially sensitive professional and personal information like the presence of a person at an abortion clinic, an AIDS counselor, attendance of a religious place, etc. could be exposed which unfortunately poses a threat to locational privacy.</p>



<h4><strong>Medical Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Medical Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Confidentiality and privacy are essential to all trusting relationships such as that between a doctor and a patient. Patient confidentiality and protection of privacy have always been the basis of the doctor-patient relationship. People usually do not prefer that their medical records be revealed to others because of the fact that it may affect their medical insurance, employment, and that it may bring embarrassment upon them.</p>



<p>Medical privacy may include information relating to physical and sexual activity, genetic data, bodily functions, psychological problems, etc.</p>



<p>In 2018, the healthcare sector saw 15 million patient records compromised in 503 breaches, three times the amount seen in the previous year, according to the Protenus Breach Barometer.</p>



<h4><strong>Educational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In earlier days, photocopies, textbooks, and filmstrips supplied the entire educational content to the students. However, with the advancement of technology and telecommunications, the education system has greatly changed and a new system including personalized content, virtual forms of interaction, and interactive technologies has been introduced.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though the adopters of these technologies have proved their worth by transforming the educational process however, the use of high-tech education systems has proved to be a double-edged sword. Using information systems like Arcon and portal, tools like Microsoft Office and Google, educational Apps like Edmodo and Dropbox exposes the student data to a number of security and privacy risks. Technologies like information sharing, telecommunication innovations, and web-hosting also expose the information related to students to risks during their use.</p>



<p>In 2020, cybersecurity firm Cybele discovered at least 530,000 zoom accounts listed for sale on a dark web hacker forum for $0.0020 cents.</p>



<p>The data relating to students so exposed or improperly disclosed can cause significant harm to students where students may indulge in violating each other’s privacy like online gossip, cyberbullying, etc. Besides, it can also result in a misunderstanding between schools and parents, alumni, applicants, and others.</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy Risks</strong></h4>



<p>As personal information has become the subject of a digitized world, the risks of cyber attacks have increasingly posed a threat to data privacy. The data privacy risks have the tendency to cause a data breach when a cybercriminal infiltrates a data source and extracts confidential information. While most data breaches occur due to hacking or malware attacks other methods include accidental data sharing, employee data theft, internet fraud, etc.</p>



<p><strong>The most common data breaches occur due to the following risks:</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Accidental Data Sharing&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Personal data is usually exposed by cybercriminals however, sometimes the company’s own employees accidentally share and misplace consumer’s sensitive data resulting in the data breach. For example in 2018, hundreds of Australian’s personally identifiable information and health information we&#8217;re exposed to the public after an employee accidentally shared some sensitive data with an organizational outsider.</p>



<p><strong>• Employee Data Theft</strong></p>



<p>The data theft by a departing employee is a bigger threat than that of a hacker. It occurs most frequently when an employee leaves or resigns from an organization to work for a competitor or to set up their own rival company. For instance, Levandowski in 2019, stole diagrams and drawings related to simulations, radar technology, and Light Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), source code snippets, PDFs marked as confidential, Videos of test drives, and Marketing information from Google and provided it to Uber.</p>



<p><strong>Most commonly the data theft includes stealing of customer information, financial records, Email list, process document, employees records etc.</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;• Ransomware</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ransomware attacks have been becoming grave as the years pass by. Ransomware is the form of malware that encrypts the victim’s file. The attacker then demands the victim to restore access to data upon payment. In order to retrieve the basic data hostage and to restore affected data, most of the organizations agree to pay the ransom to the attackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;As witnessed in 2019, the ransomware attacks have vastly affected sectors like health care, manufacturing, finance, etc. As a response to this many companies has put forth ransomware prevention as a priority in 2020.</p>



<p><strong>• Bad Password Hygiene&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Account passwords should be such so that they are difficult to guess and harder to crack. An overwhelming number of passwords may lead to poor password hygiene when there is no technology in place to help.</p>



<p>Reusing and sharing of passwords has remained a common practice in most businesses among the employees resulting in countless data breaches and individual account takeovers.</p>



<p>The incidents leading to poor password hygiene may include selecting passwords that are obvious, selecting the same password for each account, temptation to share passwords with others for convenience, and writing down the passwords for easy recall, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Phishing Emails&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A phishing attack is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon to lure the victim with an attempt to obtain sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It manipulates the victims into performing certain actions like clicking on a malicious link or willfully disclosing the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>• Internet Frauds&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The main aim of internet fraud usually is to deceive the victim or to otherwise take advantage of them by stealing the information. such information can be used for financial gain by making fraudulent transactions, draining bank accounts, etc. which may result in significant reputational repercussions and increase the risk of class action lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>one of the oldest internet fraud examples is Nigerian Email scams. Someone from a country (often Nigeria, but not always) contacts you via email in broken English. They explain that a rich person they know has died and the money has nowhere to go; if you can help them get the funds out of the country, they’ll give you some as a reward</p>



<p>The most prominent internet frauds are online shopping frauds, email scams, identity theft, tax scams, lottery frauds, matrimonial frauds, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Bribery&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bribery mostly results in serious data security concern to those companies whose data and intellectual property is incredible of high value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though bribery not being the most convenient way to perpetuate data, however, the officials of a company can be bribed into revealing the company’s confidential data. In 2018, the employees of Amazon were accused of participating in a bribery scheme that compromises customer data, and a year later it was discovered that AT&amp;T employees received bribes to plant malware on the company’s network.</p>



<h4><strong>How important is Data Privacy?</strong></h4>



<p>Data is an incredibly important part of a company’s asset, collecting and sharing of data can be a big business in today’s digital world but for a business to safely and successfully take advantage of data they are collecting, they need to have safeguards in place to ensure that data is under tight lock and consumers are not subject to uninvited surveillance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this age of digital economy, true company value lies in the collected customer data which is an asset, worthy of being protected. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data created and stored continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Any information stored digitally needs to be properly protected right from financial information and payment details to contact information. Data protection is not only a legal necessity but crucial for protecting and maintaining the business also.</p>



<p>Data privacy importance lies in the fact that individuals are able to maintain their autonomy and individuality over how their personal information moves into the economy and society. The right to privacy is the fundamental right of an individual so he is at liberty to protect his data and regulate its use.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Data Privacy Tips</strong>:</p>



<p>While the new decade promised an unexplored revolution in the field of Information Technology which has blurred the lines between the real world and the virtual one, it becomes vital for people to be more concerned about their privacy. </p>



<p><strong>Some tips that may help to create a friendly environment for commerce, learning, and communication are listed as follows;</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Use a Safe Search Engine</strong></p>



<p>It’s possible that sometimes a person can be scammed easily by fake engines leading one to fake pages that look like true intended sites. So if one intends to search an online retailer, instead of searching him through the search engine, one should directly visit the secure https:// page or use the App launched by such retailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>•<strong> Use Two Factor Authentication</strong></p>



<p>Two-factor authentication is a higher level of security process than the single factor authentication method in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. It adds an extra layer of security by making the logins extra secure and difficult for hackers to hack sensitive information. It confirms the identity of a person by using two factors one is the password and the other is the security token or a biometric factor, such as fingerprint or facial scan.</p>



<p>• <strong>Anti-Virus Software&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The updated Anti-virus software program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware can better protect sensitive data from being hacked. It not only safeguards from malicious files and viruses but also helps to protect personal information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Digital Vault</strong></p>



<p>Digital Vault is an online vault that protects the information inside it by securing the data from all major risks over the network. It provides great help in securing all the necessary information like a credit card, social security, driving license, passport numbers, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Safe Wi-Fi Environment</strong></p>



<p>The public wifi is inherently less secure than that of the personal one because the number of connections is not known. One should always avail of the safest security protocol to avoid data theft or privacy issues while on public wifi. For this purpose, one can use a secure VPN that hides the IP address and encrypts the information over the web.</p>



<p>• <strong>Limited Information on Social Media</strong></p>



<p>For the protection of personal data, one should avoid personally identifiable information to be shared on social networking sites which could be later used as answers to security questions. The social media privacy settings should be updated to limit the information collected by different sites and who can see the information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Strong Passwords</strong></p>



<p>One should always create strong passwords by making use of capital letters, lowercase, numbers, special characters and change them often. The stronger the password, the more difficult a threat will be.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>How much are&nbsp;the Countries Concerned?</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1IP5XARUhpT-d-CjaXxDGVOB3hs1R1cuuMRuKqU7L_SCvYVdZ0daDj1IRFkOUcmAeUTB-lu3qY7B0MkFErI5Q17-pVrXWMLy9CMMoAky0bgpDf7FgM_VnstJgF7qFdFYI8umBXM6" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In order to address the data privacy issues like data theft, phishing email attacks, ransomware attacks, etc. almost every country around the Globe has enacted data privacy legislation under their municipal laws. These laws govern the rules and regulations for the collection, storage, and use of collected data in a legitimate manner. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the privacy laws around the world are as follows:</strong></p>



<p>1. <strong>CCPA</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act / USA&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Officially in effect on January 1st, 2020, this legislation demands the companies to inform the user of data processing, take extra measures to protect user information, and allow users a say in what data is collected and how it is shared.</p>



<p><strong>2. CALOPPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The California Online Privacy Protection Act/ USA.</strong></p>



<p>This Act requires commercial websites to post privacy policies detailing data collection and use on their website.</p>



<p><strong>3. CFAA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act/US.</strong></p>



<p>The law prohibits accessing the computer without authorization or excess of authorization in order to reduce the instances of malicious hacking.</p>



<p><strong>4. PIPEDA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act/Canada.</strong></p>



<p>This Act mandates that businesses using data for, or in the course of, commercial activities, must disclose the purpose of that data collection to the owners of that data, and obtain consent to proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. LGPD</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lei Geral de Protèçao de dados Pessoais/ Brazil.</strong></p>



<p>LGPD is landmark legislation outlining data processing standards, including the ten legal bases on which the data can be processed. While the law was modeled after the EU GDPR it is notably less strict.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>PDP</strong></p>



<p><strong>National Directorate of Personal Data Protection/ Argentina.</strong></p>



<p>This law replaced Argentina’s Personal Data Protection Law and it gave users for the first time in Argentina the right to request, the deletion, and transfer of data.</p>



<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>GDPR</strong></p>



<p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation/EU.</strong></p>



<p>It sets the strictest and most far-reaching standards for the handling of user data. It is based on the principles of consent, transparency, protection, and user control, and threatens fines as high as 4% of a company&#8217;s annual revenue.</p>



<p><strong>8. e-Privacy</strong></p>



<p><strong>e-Privacy Directive and Regulation/ EU.</strong></p>



<p>The ePrivacy Directive is often referred to as cookie law due to its requirement that websites obtain user consent to non-essential cookies before launching those cookies.</p>



<p><strong>9. BBSG</strong></p>



<p><strong>Budesdatenschupzgesetz/Germany.</strong></p>



<p>This Law sets rigid standards under which businesses are required to adopt and maintain protective measures for data stored in IT systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>10. POPI</strong></p>



<p><strong>Protection Of Personal Information Act/South Africa.</strong></p>



<p>This Law applies to all South African organizations. It sets a standard of accountability for responsible data processing and establishes the requirement of customer consent to direct marketing outreach.</p>



<p><strong>11. Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018(India).</strong></p>



<p>After the Right to Privacy was determined as a Fundamental Human Right in 2017. India’s first Data Privacy Law was quickly created. The legislation sets privacy and data protection standards and notably introduces mandatory annual data audits.</p>



<p><strong>12. Cyber Security Law (china).</strong></p>



<p>China’s was enacted to increase data protection, data localization, and cybersecurity in the interest of national security.</p>



<p><strong>13. ECPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Electronic Communications Privacy Act/ US.</strong></p>



<p>It prohibits the third party from disclosing private electronic communication without authorization.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Data privacy has generated the attention of the individuals, sharing sensitive personally identifiable information due to the privacy breach incidents which are increasing as the technology is evolving. The collection, transfer, and dissemination of information which usually takes place via the internet, get exposed to a number of risks. For this reason, it generates the attention of the public, academics, government, and the business class which is valuable for the reason that would encourage concern to be shown to the past and future of privacy protection.</p>



<p>Privacy being a fundamental right is an element of a healthy democratic society and a social property which relates to power, culture, values, social standing, liberty, and dignity among other things.</p>



<p>In order to take the account of data privacy risks, though much legislation has been enacted to address these issues, however, there are still incidents of data privacy intrusions for which the countries need to come up with the effective implementation of those legislations. Since there is an alarming rise of data privacy risks leading to data thefts and data breaches, the Legislations alone won’t count so, it’s high time that the information technology industry and government come together to lay down and regulate the effective means and norms to curb the menace of intrusion of privacy.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Gulf countries or the “Arabian Gulf” is a group of Arab states that border the Persian Gulf or, in simple terms it is often understood as the group of ‘oil-producing states’ surrounding the Persian Gulf which is a shallow marginal sea in the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Peninsula and southeastern Iran. It is a set of seven countries namely:</p>



<ol><li>Bahrain</li><li>Iraq</li><li>Kuwait</li><li>Oman</li><li>Qatar</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>United Arab Emirates<br>All these countries, except Iraq, are members of the Gulf Cooperation Committee (GCC), a regional intergovernmental organization to foster economic, scientific, and business cooperation among the member countries, and have a lot of things in common, for example, their food styles, values, cultures, etc. However, the main difference lies in their political structures. These countries form some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, mostly due to a boom in oil, natural gas, and petroleum revenues. They also dominate other OPEC ( The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries in oil production and are among the wealthiest countries of the world, on a per capita basis.</li></ol>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="384" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Q9gBDFcL5KOdhTYwf0rHdNDPaYpE5XK9MSCLeQxUKoM5-KawRCw8GQaXZx67lPgD6LdNOylIpoLpjVaizFHr5pcibQX0fs5Aunir8pe36PnXTZ0MbZ4pkB4EQmx62l4U5Ygs-A"></p>



<p><em>According to current estimates, 79.4% of the world&#8217;s proven oil reserves are located in OPEC Member Countries, with the bulk of OPEC oil reserves in the Middle East, amounting to 64.5% of the OPEC total.</em></p>



<h4><strong>A Brief History</strong></h4>



<p>“Discovery of oil” in the Gulf is what has shaped all the affairs of the region, be it history, economy, or polity. In the Gulf region, oil was first found in 1927 in northern Iraq, followed by Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and others over the years.<br>However, considering the importance and the value of the resource that was found there, the greed (amongst the Gulf countries) to take control over all oil reserves and to rule the world, lead to a number of wars, which ultimately resulted in the western intervention in their affairs and left some serious long-term implications on their internal structures, leading to the instability that is witnessed today.<br>• <strong>The Iran-Iraq War</strong></p>



<p>The roots of the Iran- Iraq War (1980-88) lay in a number of territorial and political disputes between Iraq and Iran. However, mainly Iraq wanted to seize control of the rich oil-producing Iranian border region of Khūzestān, a territory inhabited largely by ethnic Arabs. In September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded through a broad front into Khūzestān and captured the city of Khorramshahr but failed to take the important oil-refining center of Ābādān. Iran’s counterattacks began to compel the Iraqis to give ground in 1981. Later in the year 1982, Iraq voluntarily withdrew its forces from all captured Iranian territory and began seeking a peace agreement with Iran. However, the violence continued while both the nations still engaged in sporadic air and missile attacks against each other’s cities and military and oil installations. They also attacked each other’s oil-tanker shipping in the Persian Gulf. The Iran-Iraq war finally ended in 1988 only after the United Nations-brokered a ceasefire.<br>• <strong>The Gulf War</strong></p>



<p>In August 1990, Iraq invaded the country of Kuwait to its southeast in a bid to gain more control over the lucrative oil supply of the Middle East. Alarmed by these actions, fellow Arab powers such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt called on the United States and other Western nations to intervene. The then Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein defied United Nations Security Council&#8217;s demands to withdraw from Kuwait by mid-January 1991, and the Persian Gulf War began with a massive U.S.-led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm. After 42 days of relentless attacks by the allied coalition in the air and on the ground, the then U.S. President George H.W. Bush declared a cease-fire on February 28, 1991; by that time, most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled. Although, as a result of this war Kuwait was liberated, before leaving Iraqi soldiers set fire to about 500 oil wells and dumped millions of gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf, leading to an environmental crisis.</p>

<p>The end of the Gulf war did not, however, mark the end of the involvement of the United States in the Middle East, rather, towards the end of the twentieth century, the foreign policy of the United States and other western nations became more and more netted in the politics of the Gulf.</p>



<h4><strong>The Western Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>The Western intervention in the Middle East started after the end of World War I (WWI) and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. When the allies won WWI, the Middle East was divided between Britain and France according to their own interests rather than those of the ethnic groups of the region. After World War II (WWII), they did not continue in the Gulf and left, but the borders they had created remained. However, after WWII, the US started its involvement when it started to see its interests in the region. Using terrorism as a tactic and growth of OPEC and the use of oil in political ways, it began intervening in the affairs of the Gulf. The presence of oil in the region also found Britain, France, the European Union (EU), and other Western allies carving their ways into the Gulf. As already mentioned, the Gulf War gave the most sought after opportunity to the Western forces to lay their foot on the Arabian soil and shape its internal structures in every manner to support their interests.</p>



<p><strong>Iraq:</strong> On September 11, 2001, an Islamic terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, attacked the World Trade Centre in New York resulting in the killing of thousands of civilians. The US accused Iraq of supplying weapons of mass destruction to Al-Qaeda and on the pretext of seizing those weapons, the US and the allied forces attacked and occupied the Iraqi land in 2003, at the cost of savage bloodshed and mass destruction. The country came under full western control, there were armed forces bases set up, air force patrolling, etc. The US kept building up its strength in Iraq over the years to tens of thousands of soldiers until the end of 2011 when it finally started to withdraw because it did not find any strong evidence to support its claim. The role played by America and Britain post-2003 resulted in a feeling of anger and distress among Iraqis and led fundamentalist organizations to flourish, especially the Islamic State of Iraq. As a result, the US redeployed its forces in Iraq and tried to legitimize its presence in the region on various pretexts, such as protecting US officials and facilities in Iraq, helping the natives to defend themselves, and preventing a possible genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.</p>



<p>Besides Iraq, Western presence has been profound in Yemen, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and UAE as well. “Arab Spring”, which was a series of anti-governmental uprisings in the Arab world in response to the oppressive regimes and low standards of living, paved a way for the Western forces, especially the US, to further its influence in the Gulf countries like Yemen and Bahrain, apart from other Middle-East countries. The slogans which dominated the uprising were <strong>“liberty”, “dignity”, “jobs” </strong>and an<strong> “end to corruption”</strong>. The West apparently identified with these slogans and felt it was on the same side with protesters. But, it had its own interests as well &#8211; the European Union (EU) wanted to stop the Arab migration, which is viewed as a potential source of social tension, into the EU. The US had its strategic interests in the region as it is a vital global energy resource. Besides, the area was of strategic military importance for the US, France, and Britain. The US has installed some of its major army camps in Kuwait (Arifjanin and Buehring camps) and Qatar(Aaliyah camp). Besides, the US air force also maintains installations in Kuwait, UAE, and Qatar along with navy deployments in the region. Apart from this, thousands of troops have been deployed in various states across the Gulf region. It maintains stationing of several dozen personnel in Oman as well.<br>Further, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> has maintained a close relationship with the United States since its inception, given that it was the chief country that called for Western interference in the first place(during the Gulf War). The Saudi-US relations stem from the economics of oil because Saudi holds about a quarter of the world’s known oil reserves. However, some say that it is US hypocrisy because Saudi is a monarchy and its very setup is the antithesis to democracy but the US is still maintaining its ties. The US has been staying back in Saudi, saying it is concerned about the latter’s security, even though there is no formal defense agreement between the two countries. Since the 1990&#8217;s the US has been deploying tens of thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia for its defense against Iraq, and also providing ammunition as well as military training to its army. It also claims to have undertaken several counter-terrorism operations in the region along with the Saudi regime. Even though in recent times the relations of the two have not been really good, but, the military alliance between the two continues. In March 2015, President Barack Obama even declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a &#8220;Joint Planning Cell&#8221; with Saudi Arabia.</p>



<h4><strong>Consequences of Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>Ensuring the free flow of oil represents perhaps the most constant US interest in the Middle East. Europe, China, and Japan all also depend on oil imports for their energy needs. Therefore, since at least the 1970s, America’s key strategic interests in the region have involved not only securing easy access for itself but also guaranteeing an open and secure market for Japan and Europe. No doubt, the presence of Western agencies has had some positive influences on the otherwise non-democratic and non-liberal Gulf regimes and it has to a very great extent helped in the development of these countries as well. However, the fact remains, that intervention in any country&#8217;s internal affairs beyond a particular level becomes undesirable and produces contravening and destabilizing effects on that country. Similarly, years of Western intervention in the Gulf has left its ill impacts on the region on various fronts. </p>



<p><strong>Given under are some of the unfortunate effects of Western Intervention in various Gulf regions:</strong><br>• The continuous presence and intervention of the US in Iraq have had grave results on all fronts, be it humanitarian, political, economic, or cultural. Ever since 2003, millions of people have been displaced, thousands killed, nearly one-third of the population living in poverty, making it one of the biggest catastrophes of the world. The US with its entry also gave a blow to the state-owned factories and enterprises by introducing foreign investments and gradually resulted in an unprecedented increase in unemployment of the natives. Further, it also destroyed the cultural heritage of Iraq with its art museums and other important cultural institutions being damaged during the early occupation. Also, the Western presence was supposed to bring about a democratic reform but, even today, democracy remains a dream. Instead, it has increased terrorism and sectarian violence and also increased competition and rivalries amongst various regional actors. Thus, as far as Iraq is concerned, an intervention (from the West) which was justified on humanitarian grounds, resulted in a grossly negative impact and distorted its entire structure, while not even serving altogether fruitful for the US as well, as it also suffered huge loss over the years while engaging in various warfares in Iraq.</p>



<p>• Even though there has been no direct uprising against the presence of the US in Arab, but, there has been growing resentment among the masses against it. In such circumstances, supporting the Western presence by some Arab nations has resulted in an ever-developing feeling of humiliation and a strong sense of loss in the populace. Western presence has also been used by terrorist organizations to radicalize young men. This sentiment if not addressed seriously can result in further unrest in the region and may even result in a popular revolt, destroying the social, political, and economical structure very badly.<br>• As a <strong>result of the intervention</strong>, just like in Iraq, inherent tribal, sectarian, and ethnic conflicts in other countries also have intensified. Further, it has resulted in pressure upon the Arab world from two opposite directions, one, the originally Islamic Fundamentalist ideology, and two, the ‘’ democracy’’ and ‘’freedom’’ ideas promoted by Western powers.</p>



<p>• <strong>According to the United Nations</strong>, as a result of the Saudi led airstrikes in Yemen (which is in a state of war over the transition of power), 7,700 civilian deaths have taken place till March 2020, and currently Yemen is experiencing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. In doing so, the coalition has received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK, and France.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="636" height="369" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UcFIRaa05DeyNvIJvYEa0QTfgDF9prmvOBWKnRZr_K9jmiCVdh7UkTIUWekeng22b2cWQXLanH-J8YYq4XYjV1ReqRJAcPKHgSZJCJvoEi2Xu3uB7GdQOhVkZxLU4Io-84nkeg"></p>



<p><em>More than 60% of civilian deaths have been the result of Saudi-led airstrikes, the UN says [EPA]</em></p>



<p>• In <strong>Bahrain</strong>, where there was an uprising, mainly sectarian, to overthrow the existing regime in 2014, the US, along with Saudi again, cracked down upon the people seeking their rights. It adopted a policy of blanketing Manama, the capital of Bahrain, and surrounding villages with tanks and armored personnel carriers, using live ammunition as well as tear gas and rubber bullets to break up demonstrations. Even though the uprising was in its favor as it encouraged the ‘democratic sentiment’ but, it suppressed it forcefully in order to secure its larger interest, that is, its relations with Saudi Arabia. Therefore, it can be said that on one hand, the west pretends to maintain the presence of authoritarian regimes as far as it serves its interest. On the other, it prefers to pretend as if it upholds the principle of democracy by popular voices and choices in the Arab world.<br>International intervention is a common phenomenon in international relations. In the modern era of globalization and technological development, intervention by various international actors such as the United Nations and other international organizations are somewhat indispensable in order to bring about coordination in the international community and also to ensure equality and justice at the global level. However, intervention is of two types, “power intervention” and “well-intentioned intervention”. Power intervention means “interference” in the affairs of another country, whereas, well-intentioned intervention is intervening with a positive approach. The intervention thus, must with an intention to help the region to progress and to diffuse the long-existing crisis and must be up to a certain level. But, the Western intervention in the Gulf has been ‘power intervention’. At the international level, the sovereignty of a nation is the most sacred principle, respecting the authority and supremacy of a nation with respect to its internal affairs is the obligation of every other nation. Intervening to a point where it infringes the sovereignty of that country is condemnable and produces most often, devastating results, as can be witnessed in the Gulf today. A region that was supposed to be so well developed and rich is reeling under an unprecedented conflict and humanitarian crisis, as a result of years of uncontrolled Western intervention. Therefore, the international community must unite and call upon the West to withdraw from the Gulf and help it rejuvenate its culture, economy, polity, and ultimately bring about stability.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p><strong>Who are Rohingyas?</strong></p>



<p>Rohingyas are one of the many ethnic minorities of Myanmar which constitute its largest Muslim percentage. As the statistics suggest, before August 2017, nearly 1 million Rohingyas, which accounts for about one-third of the population, resided in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. Apart from that, almost 3.5 million Rohingyas are dispersed worldwide.</p>



<p>Myanmar, which is a majority-Buddhist state, considers Rohingya Muslims as “Bangladeshis” and does not recognise them as its citizens. They were not even included in the 2014 census. Over the years, Myanmar has been accused of committing grave human rights violations and atrocities on Rohingyas such as torture, rape, enforced disappearances, destruction of properties, etc. forcing them to flee to different neighbouring countries, especially, Bangladesh. According to the most recently available data, more than 168,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since 2012.</p>



<h4>History of the Rohingya Crisis</h4>



<p>The conflict dates back to 1948 (after Myanmar’s independence from British rule) when the Union Citizenship Act passed by the government, excluding Rohingyas from its ambit, lead to a Muslim rebellion in the Rakhine state. This Act, however, allowed Rohingyas who had been living in Myanmar for two generations or more to apply for identity cards. But, in 1982, a new Citizenship Act was passed which identified 135 national, ethnic groups, excluding Rohingyas altogether. Thus, rendering them completely ‘stateless’. This led to another popular uprising followed by a military crackdown on the Rohingyas from 1989-1991, as a result of which, around 250,000 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh. </p>



<p>The conflict between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in the Rakhine state intensified in 2012 when the Arakanese political party along with the Buddhist monks and ordinary Arakanese attacked Rohingya and Kaman Muslim communities. In this violence, many were killed and buried in mass graves, and more than 1,00,000 people fled to Malaysia. In 2014, Myanmar conducted its first census in 30 years, and still not included Rohingyas as an ethnic group.<br>As a result, the Arkani Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked a border post of Myanmar security forces in 2016, which was again followed by a military crackdown on innocent Rohingya civilians. During the crackdown, about 87,000 people fled to Bangladesh. However, the tension intensified to even greater levels in August 2017 after the Rohingya militia (ARSA) attacked more than 30 police posts on August 25, 2017. The Myanmar army responded by launching an unprecedented and deadly attack on the Rohingya community. At least 6,700 Rohingyas, including 730 Children under 5 years of age, were killed in that month according to Medicine San Frontiers (MSF) and more than 700,000 Rohingya fled from Myanmar. In 2018 after the UN scaled its response (after the 2017 mass exodus) and accused the Myanmar military of atrocities against Rohingya Muslims, Bangladesh and Myanmar government offered refugees a chance to return to Myanmar. However, not even a single person returned, fearing their lives. In 2019, there was further violence which led to the displacement of another 4,500 Rohingya people.</p>

<h4>The Bangladesh Crisis:</h4>



<p>This Rohingya refugee crisis is among the largest, fastest movements of people in recent history. As a result of August 2017 violence during which indiscriminate and widespread attacks and killings were perpetrated by the Myanmar security forces against the Rohingyas, which was referred to as the “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” by the UN Human Rights Commissioner, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar have fled to Bangladesh. They joined another almost 300,000 refugees who had fled years before to escape the violence in Myanmar. </p>



<p>This mass movement has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh with nearly 1 million Rohingyas taking refuge there in various camps along the border. Today, about 860,000 Rohingya refugees live in Kutapalong refugee camps which form the largest and most densely populated refugee settlement of the world according to UNHCR. Cox’ Bazar district follows next with about 850,000 refugees take shelter there. By September 2019, around 914,000 Rohingya were estimated to need assistance as most of those, especially women and children, who are arriving in Bangladesh, are traumatized and mostly injured by gunshots, shrapnel, fire, and landmines.</p>



<p>This entire situation has resulted in a great strain on the resources of Bangladesh. As such, on April 23, 2020, Bangladesh’s Foreign Minister, Abdul Moen said the country would refuse entry to more Rohingya. This decision resulted in aggravation in the crisis as the Rohingya people were left with nowhere to go! However, the UN intervened immediately with UNHCR raising serious concerns about the push-backs, urging ‘greater coordination and responsibility-sharing by states to address the maritime movements of refugees and asylum Seekers protected man Sea. Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said, “Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina has called herself the ‘Mother of Humanity’ for offering protection to Rohingya fleeing Myanmar, but now her government is turning its back on these refugees”. Human Rights Watch also has said that “Bangladesh should continue to uphold its international obligations not to return refugees to places where they face persecution and to return anyone to where they would face a risk of torture or ill-treatment”.</p>

<h4>Relief Programs</h4>



<p>There are over 200 aid agencies operating in the Rohingya camps. With a few exceptions, who are allegedly involved in corruption and nepotism, these agencies have been working tirelessly over the years to provide all sorts of humanitarian and other assistance to the refugees living in various camps in Bangladesh. </p>



<p>WHO, UNICEF, UNOCHA, OXFAM, MSF, Save the Children, World Vision are some of the prominent UN agencies and NGOs working in refugee camps in Bangladesh. These organisations broadly provide aid through:<br><strong>• Providing health services,</strong> including life-saving drugs, maternal and child-care services, emergency medical services.<br>•<strong> Nutrition:</strong> these agencies, with their nutrition experts, provide proper nutritious diets to refugees, especially children, and pregnant women, to prevent malnutrition.<br>• <strong>Child protection and education: </strong>they also work towards the safety of children against various illnesses such as diarrhea, respiratory illnesses, by providing proper medical care. Besides, they provide protection against various forms of exploitation such as child marriage, sexual violence, physical violence, and human trafficking.<br><strong>• Education: </strong>in collaboration with UNICEF, many NGOs have been providing informal education to the children in refugee camps, especially between ages 3-14, besides providing vocational training to adolescents aged 15-18.<br>• <strong>Installing sewage facilities</strong>, water points, toilets, showers, distributing sanitation products such as soaps and other essentials, installing solar-powered lights, etc.</p>



<h4>Government Policies</h4>



<h4>Myanmar:</h4>



<p>The Myanmar government does not recognise Rohingyas as citizens of Myanmar. It considers them as ‘Bangladeshis’ and refers to them as ‘Bengalis’. The World Report released by the Human Rights Watch in 2019 reported, “The Rohingya refugees who fled in 2018 reported that Myanmar authorities had ordered them to accept the National Verification Card – which does not provide citizenship – or leave Myanmar. Successive governments have for decades deprived Rohingya of nationality through systematic and institutionalized marginalization, rendering them stateless.” Earlier in 2017, the Myanmar state officials even went to an extent of altogether denying the existence of Rohingyas.<br>“There is no such thing as Rohingya”, said U Kyaw San Hla, an officer in the state security ministry. “It&#8217;s fake news”.<br>Human rights watchdogs have warned there is a danger of the Rohingya history being eradicated by the military campaigns. In a report released in October 2019, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said that Myanmar’s security forces had worked to “effectively erase all signs of memorable landmarks in the geography of the Rohingya landscape and memory in such a way that a return to their lands would yield nothing but a desolate and unrecognizable terrain”. The report also said the crackdown in Rakhine had targeted teachers, cultural and religious leadership, and other people of influence in the Rohingya community in an effort to diminish Rohingya&#8217;s history, culture, and knowledge”.<br>However, Myanmar has been denying almost all the allegations of human rights violations or other violence against Rohingyas. It says the 2017 military crackdown was a direct response to the ARSA militant attacks. Myanmar’s security officials accepted the killing of 10 Rohingya men in September 2017 in Inn Din Village only after the massacre was ‘exposed’ by the media. A year later, in September 2018, two journalists were convicted for breaking the state’s secret laws and sentenced to 7 years in prison.<br>Myanmar, in an attempt to hide the reality from the world, continues to bar international investigators, including the UN-mandated fact-finding mission and UN’s special rapporteur for the country, Yanghee Lee, to probe the violence on its soil.</p>



<h4>Bangladesh:</h4>



<p>Bangladesh lacks the wealth and infrastructure necessary to deal with a disaster of the scale it now confronts: it is an overpopulated and underdeveloped country that is prone to natural disasters and rising sea levels. The country is now struggling to cope with the pressure of hosting approximately 1 million stateless Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar. Nevertheless, Bangladeshis have largely united in support of the Rohingya refugees. In a rare show of agreement, opposition parties backed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s decision to shelter the Rohingya fleeing violence, at least for the time being. However, taking it as a short-term challenge, without any long-term planning or a blueprint for the future for the State to act on, could not produce any successful outcomes, with the crisis deepening every day. Although Bangladesh started with a very positive approach, such as when the violence against Rohingya refugees began to rise in Southern Bangladesh, the Central Government reacted very stringently. It put strict retractions on refugees and NGO’s that interfered with the humanitarian assistance in the camps. However, recently, Bangladesh began to impose new restrictions on refugees and NGOs working in the camps, such as restrictions on freedom of movement and the use of mobile phones. <strong>“The government’s actions are an easy solution to a bigger problem”</strong>, said Imtiaz Ahmad, director of the Centre for Genocide Studies at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh in relation to the communication restrictions and challenges of security and repatriation. Bangladesh had previously banned the sale of SIM cards in the camps. It also began fencing some of the camps and saying it will install watchtowers and surveillance cameras. It also announced that it would begin relocating some refugees to the Silt Island in the Bay of Bengal, despite that being prone to very harsh weather. It has also cut off internet connectivity in the camps. It also removed the local officials working in the camps who were sympathetic towards the refugees. Further, not been allowed to work in Bangladesh, the stateless Rohingya refugees are desperate and are only permitted to work as part-time volunteers. Therefore, besides financial impacts, these policies have increased the vulnerability and insecurities of Rohingyas.<br>Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch’s Asia director, said in a statement that Bangladesh faced a challenge in dealing with the refugee crisis but “made matters worse by imposing restrictions on refugee communications and freedom of movement”. Despite knowing the fact that the refugees are not ready to go anytime soon, the government has failed to make any long-term, multi-layered policy to handle the situation on humanitarian grounds. The government has also not been able to seriously take up the repatriation of refugees with Myanmar. Hence, the current approach of the Bangladesh government is only adding to the humanitarian crisis already being faced by the refugees (emphasis supplied).</p>



<h4>United Nations’ Stand</h4>



<p>In December 2019, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution condemning human rights abuses against Muslim Rohingyas and other minorities in Myanmar. It called on Myanmar to stop the incitement of hatred against Rohingya and other minorities. It further called upon Myanmar to protect all groups and to ensure justice for all violations of human rights, while highlighting the findings of an independent international mission “of gross human rights violations and abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities” by Myanmar’s security forces, which the mission described as “gravest crimes under international law”.<br>However, the problem With such resolutions is that these are not legally binding upon the state against which they are passed but merely reflect the world opinion.<br>Further, there was a case brought against Myanmar by the Gambia for the human rights violations in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and very recently, in January 2020, ICJ ordered Myanmar to prevent genocidal violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority and preserve any evidence of past crimes. These orders are binding on Myanmar.</p>



<h4>Why Does this Crisis Matter?</h4>



<p>The humanitarian crisis that unfolded as a result of the violence that erupted in Myanmar’s Rakhine state is one of the biggest of its nature in the world. As stated by UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, “…Rohingya people have always been one, if not the only, of the most discriminated people in the world, without any recognition of the basic rights…” There have been allegations of, amongst other things, torture, rapes, arbitrary detentions, destruction of property against the Myanmar government. Besides, there have been well planned, institutionalised, and systematic actions by Myanmar security forces to eradicate the existence of the whole Rohingya community. They are being denied their identity, they are forced to leave their homeland and scatter in different parts of the world.</p>



<p><strong>Therefore, a crisis of this nature and scale becomes important for various reasons.</strong><br>Firstly, <strong>“human rights”</strong> is a very sensitive topic in the world right now. It is the touchstonetouch stone of every action of every government and its agencies. Much stress has been given to the protection and respect for human rights under very international documents. Despite that, human rights violations on such a large scale necessitate looking into what actually is being done at the international level for upholding the values of human life, human dignity, human liberty, and human security; and what needs to be further done to put an end to this crisis.<br>Secondly, this crisis poses a <strong>threat to the peace and security</strong> of the entire world. This has two aspects. One, being exposed to such a crisis has a Huge tendency to radicalize young refugee men and <strong>convert them into terrorists</strong>, suicide bombers, etc. and two, it <strong>creates a sense of insecurity and vulnerability</strong> in the minds of all the minority communities around the world. It makes them feel that the majority can do anything with impunity, and there is no one to protect them and their rights. This will create a hostile environment in the world with people, especially minority communities, losing their faith in international law. Therefore, it becomes extremely important to deal with this crisis on a speedy and stringent basis.<br>Thirdly, such a crisis such crisis also <strong>leads to internal disturbances </strong>in the host countries. Countries like Bangladesh, which already have a lot of domestic issues to deal with, are posed with an additional burden to accommodate and care for the refugees. Such a crisis such crisis damages the social, environmental, political, economic, and cultural atmosphere of the host country. Problems like ecological degradation, sanitation problems, malnutrition, the spread of diseases, increased crime rate, trafficking, etc. are all inevitable products of such products such a crisis. Therefore, in this context also it is essential to understand the crisis in every aspect and address it in the best possible way, in order to reduce its impact on the refugees as well the host countries.<br>Lastly, there are some additional concerns with regard to this conflict, such as a <strong>very negative impact </strong>on the children, women, and other vulnerable groups such as the old. In the world that preaches liberty, this crisis has restricted them to their uninhabitable refugee camps without having the freedom to live a dignified and progressive life.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>Therefore, this crisis is a situation of extreme urgency, which demands a swift and collective effort from all international stakeholders in the interest of millions of displaced people and in the larger part of world peace.</p>
