<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Road accidents are the most unwanted common thing nowadays. As the number of people buying automobiles is increasing, the number of road accidents is also increasing. Motorization although has eased life in many aspects, but it has come with a price. Road accidents claim over a million precious lives every year across the globe. World Health Organization (WHO) reports providing those road accidents are one of the leading causes of death, among other reasons. Road accidents are basically an outcome of an interplay among different factors that comprise the vehicle, environment, and the human being. India, which is a vigorously developing country, has its issues relating to road accidents due to the rapid expansion of motorization.&nbsp; Traditionally, road accidents are looked at as unpredictable, inevitable, and not preventable. However, road accidents are predictable and preventable in most cases. The only requirement is adherence to traffic rules and specific other precautionary and preventive measures. The adoption of preventive steps would help in decreasing the mortality rate due to road accidents.</p>



<h4>Contributing Causes of Road Accidents in India</h4>



<p>Road accidents mainly occur due to reckless and over-speed driving, not following basic traffic rules, overhauling, and poor maintenance of the vehicles. Below mentioned are some common driving errors which cause most road accidents.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Human Activities</strong></h4>



<h4>1.1 <strong>O</strong>ver Speeding:</h4>



<p>&nbsp;Almost 64% of road deaths are caused by over speeding. According to data collected by Save Life Foundation, almost 60% of the accidents in India occur on highways, mostly because of speeding. The most deaths due to speeding were in Rajasthan (9,618 deaths), followed by Tamil Nadu (9,224 deaths) and Karnataka (8,714 deaths). The current speed limit in the country is 80 km per hour on a 4-lane highway. However, the WHO has recommended that if we reduce the speed limit to about 55-57 km per hour, we could save around 30%-37% lives.</p>



<h4><strong>1.2 Drunk Driving:</strong></h4>



<p> Drunk driving is the other leading cause of road fatalities. Drunk driving is a serious offense and as per rules laid down by the court, any driver found with more than 30 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood is under the influence of alcohol and is a culprit of drunk driving. &nbsp; According to National Crime Records Bureau’s report on Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2015, about 1.5 percent of all the total 4.64 lakh road accidents were caused by drunk driving, resulting in injuries to 6,295 people. However in 2017 and 2018 accidents under the influence of alcohol or drugs has declined by 14% because of an increase in fines and better implementation of laws,</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>1.3&nbsp; Driving License</strong>:</h4>



<p>&nbsp;The statistics provided by a report released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways on ‘Road Accidents in India, 2018’ was shocking it shows that about 74% of road accidents involved drivers holding a valid driver’s license and 26% of road accidents are caused by drivers who did not have a valid license or were driving with a learner’s license, which clearly indicates that license is not signed that driver is qualified. For example, if we ask a driver about any basic rule of the road, like blind spots in their vehicle while driving almost 99% will not be aware.</p>



<h4><strong>1.4 </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Avoiding Safety Gears like seat Belts and Helmets:</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;As many as 48,746 people were killed riding two-wheelers in road accidents in 2017, of which 74% or 35,975 were not wearing a helmet. Likewise, 26,896 people killed in road accidents did not fasten seat belts&#8211;these included drivers as well as passengers.“Safety devices such as helmets and seatbelts do not prevent accidents but are critical for averting fatal and grievous injuries in an event of road accidents,” the road accidents 2017 report said. “Correct helmet use” can reduce the risk of fatal injuries by 42% and risk of head injuries by 69%, the World Health Organization’s Global Status Report On Road Safety 2018, said. “Wearing a seat-belt reduces the risk of death among drivers and front-seat occupants by 45-50% and the risk of death and serious injuries among rear seat occupants by 25%.”</p>



<h4><strong>2. R</strong>oad Environment </h4>



<p>The causes related to the category of road environment include (i) accidents happening in a particular geographical area (residential, commercial institutional, etc), (ii) those related to the type of road features including straight, curved, steep, etc, (iii) type of junction &amp; type of traffic control, (iv) weather condition, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Present Scenario in India</h4>



<p>Taking road safety as a serious issue, in 2015, India signed the Brasilia declaration and committed to reducing road accidents and fatalities by half. So far, the fall in road accidents has not been so satisfactory. In 2017, road accidents in India decreased by merely 3.27% with 4, 64,910 road crashes as against 4, 80,652 in 2016. Fatalities resulting from these accidents were an even smaller drop &#8212; just 1.9%. As many as 147,913 individuals have died in road crashes in 2017 against 1, 50,785 in 2016. This not so encouraging data is further marred by road fatal figures of the first quarter of 2018 which shows a 1.68% rise over the corresponding quarter. Road accident severity measured by the number of persons killed per 100 accidents, has seen an increase of 0.6 percentage points in 2018 over the previous year. India ranks 1st in the number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and the US. As per the WHO Global Report on Road Safety 2018, India accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the World.</p>



<h4>Policy Making And Policy Implementation Regarding Road Accidents In India</h4>



<h4>Position of Law in India</h4>



<p>India has the world&#8217;s second-largest road network and it accounts for 10% of the fatalities caused by road accidents worldwide. The laws which regulate the traffic on the road are provided under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The law gives in detail all the legislative policies and provisions with regard to licensing of drivers, registration of motor vehicles, state transport undertakings, traffic regulation, liability, insurance, offenses, and penalties, etc. The compliance of traffic-related regulations is enforced by concerned agencies which include Traffic police. The parliament of India has recently made an amendment to the Motor Vehicles act, 1988 to control traffic-related issues and to place stringent punishment for violators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Some of important traffic laws under the said Act are:</strong></p>



<ol><li>If a person is found driving with more than 30 mg of alcohol in 100ml of his blood, the police have the power to arrest that person without any warrant. Imprisonment for drunken driving may extend up to 06 months and/or fine up to Rs. 10,000 for first-time offenders and imprisonment may extend up to 02 years and/or Rs. 15,000 for second-time offenders. This provision is made to contain drunken driving which is a major cause of road accidents.</li><li>Two-wheeler riders are required to wear helmets and the maximum limit for riders is two on bikes etc.</li><li>If any person/s is found racing and speeding, the police have powers to arrest and imprisonment may extend for one-month and/or fine up to Rs 500 for first-time offenders, and for second offenders, imprisonment may extend up to one- month and/or fine up to Rs 10,000.</li><li>If a person is found driving despite being disqualified from driving, the said person would attract a penalty up to Rs. 10,000.</li><li>If a person is found driving an uninsured vehicle, he/she may be punished with imprisonment and/or with a fine.</li></ol>



<h4>Policy Implementation in India</h4>



<p>The Government and the concerned agencies are putting their best to stop the fatalities which are caused due to road accidents. However, India has one of the worst road-safety records in the world. As per data from Road Accidents in India 2018, over the last decade, more than a million people who are mostly aged between 15 &#8211; 45 years, have lost their lives on the roads.</p>



<p>The major reason for this failure remains poor enforcement. India has stricter Traffic laws than other countries but unfortunately, these laws are not enforced properly.</p>



<p><strong>Some of the critical issues which need to be resolved to make roads of India less accident-prone:</strong></p>



<ol><li>The amendments made in Motor Vehicles law in force are relevant to metro cities only. Its enforcement in the whole of India is irrelevant without an upgrade to the infrastructure of roads which includes road widening, removal of encroachments from sidewalks, and bazaars from main roads. First, a conducive environment for driving needs to be set up, only then heavy fines could be imposed on errant drivers.</li><li>It is the national highways that remain the area of concern where 30% of accidents and 36% of deaths take place. These fatal road accidents are majorly attributed to faulty layout or construction defects which include erroneous road designs, sharp curves, slippery surface, poor illumination, etc. Therefore the National Highway Authority of India would have to invest more so that the faults are corrected right away and road accidents are contained.</li><li>In rural India, road accidents deaths mainly occur due to driving without helmets, trucks, motorcycles, and tractors without proper lights; incautious construction of speed-breakers, and roadside Dhabas encroachments.</li><li>There lacks proper driving education and training among the general masses. Road safety education needs to be imparted to improve the behavioral factor of people which leads to accidents. Road safety programs need to be held at schools, colleges, etc.</li><li>India has a poor ratio of traffic police to the number of motor vehicles present across the country. This makes the task of traffic control and management very difficult.</li></ol>



<h4>Road Safety Measures In Low-Income Countries(LMC&#8217;s)</h4>



<p>The safety of road users is a global health issue because large proportions of unintentional injuries are caused by traffic-related crashes. According to the Global Health Observatory, 1.35 million fatalities occur on the world’s roads each year. This problem becomes even more critical in low-income countries (LICs), due to several faults in road safety standards, vehicle safety and maintenance, and in the design and implementation of policies and safe transportation infrastructure. With the aim of reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities and guide road safety policies and strategies, several steps at a global level are taken, many of which are coordinated through the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 developed by the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC) . Efforts at the global level have generally focused on the practical implementation of policies and standards to improve road safety in the developing world. There is no single remedy to make roads safer in low- to middle-income nations; the problem must be tackled using a mixture of new safety technologies and well-established approaches.</p>



<p>Government investment in road safety management, enforcement, and post-crash response is insufficient in many developing countries. This marks a stark contrast to the United States where, in the past 50 years, government-regulated adoption of improved vehicle safety technologies, including seat belts, airbags, and electronic stability control is thought to have saved more than 600,000 lives. While improving the quality of roads and post-crash care will help, the implementation of basic safety standards and legislation is a crucial first step in saving lives. For example, in 2014, the Asia Injury Prevention Foundation presented a study to the Cambodian government which stated that 561 lives could be saved, 10,572 head injuries prevented, and USD $98 million saved by 2020 if legislators made motorcycle helmets mandatory. Road users, governments, and businesses must work together to make progress on road safety in the developing world, and ultimately reduce the number of crashes that occur.</p>



<h4>Suggestive Steps To Avoid Road Accidents:</h4>



<p>To reduce road accidents Three E (Education, Enforcement, and Engineering) formulas must be followed.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Education:</strong></h4>



<p><strong> </strong>Educating the populace, and children in particular, about road safety and good road user behavior, can help to reduce the number and severity of crashes. Communities and families have a considerable potential to influence the young and road safety programs to need to be developed in support of formal school programs. Also, the drivers should be given training about road safety, in the modern world social media has great control over the life of people, a campaign can also be started on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram to educate people about road safety measures.</p>



<h4><strong>2. Enforcement:</strong> </h4>



<p> Improving road safety through enforcement of legislation can also help promote road safety. Just like speed limits, there are many other traffic rules which must be followed to avoid road accidents like, traffic signals- taking cognizance and observing them, parking control measures, following one-way traffic regulations, including strictness in issuing a driving license for a different purpose, strictly check on drivers, vehicle condition, patrolling of law enforcing persons, an annual check of vehicle condition before the renewal of vehicle license.</p>



<h4><strong>3. Engineering</strong>:</h4>



<p> Engineers who implement careful access management can improve roadway safety for all vehicles while also promoting pedestrian safety and increased access for cyclists.&nbsp; Designing of road surfaces to reduce slip and increase friction, selection of safe design speed, which means design for slow speed where pedestrians are more likely to survive being hit by a car than die, channelization (particularly at intersections), the width of shoulders, parking, curves, traffic control devices, minimize the number of entries/exits.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Roads are the largest sources of interconnectivity. They are the vital sources of providing social, financial, health, and tourism connectivity. However, if safety measures are not taken up, roads can lead an individual to fatal consequences. It may not be possible to avoid all the road accidents which no country in the world has achieved yet. However, it is possible to minimize them by discharging our responsibilities as road users. Lost money can be earned, outdated vehicles can be replaced, and torn roads can be repaired, but human lives lost can never be replaced. Hence let us all learn to use roads responsibly and enable other road users to become participants in safe road initiatives. However, there is also a dire need for compliance with the stricter traffic laws. There is a need to understand the fact that we have not jumped on the road to enter a race, overtaking from the wrong side, etc. we could reach our destination even without rash driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>&nbsp;The means of production are owned and controlled by private businesses and the government has no role to play in production or prices. It is also known as a free market economy or free enterprise economy. This economic system is dominant in the Western world, mainly.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy is one of the oldest economic systems in the world which emerged during the 17th century. Capitalist Economy arose from a systematic breakdown of feudalism as a social and economic system and the imposition of a wage-labor system in its place. It first started with merchants who were a link between customer and producer. However, they gradually dominated the latter by placing orders and paying in advance. Then became more powerful by supplying them raw material and paying wages for finished production. The Merchant then made the transition to capitalism by making profits from the ownership and control of means of production. As time passed by, mercantilism gradually evolved into the economic practices that would eventually be called Capitalism. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The Capitalist Economy is the most predominant in the current global economy. The USA, UK, Germany, Japan, Singapore, etc. are the classical examples of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Characteristics of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, private individuals and/or businesses own the capital good, that is, production. The production of goods and services is wholly based on the supply and demand in the market. The private individuals are unrestrained and without any interference from the side of government. They decide on their own as to where to invest the capital, what and how to produce, where and what to sell, and at which prices to exchange the goods and services.</p>



<p>Some of the chief characteristics of a Capitalist Economy could be summarized as:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Economic Freedom:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, every individual is free to make economic choices without any intervention by the government. This freedom applies to both producers and consumers. Producers are free to produce any goods or services as per demand in the market. Similarly, consumers are free to buy the things they desire. Also, the workers are free to take employment wherever they desire and investors are free to invest wherever they get higher profit.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Profit Motive:</strong></h4>



<p>The driving force behind a capitalist economy is the profit motive. Business establishments exist to make a profit. The motive for the production and sale of goods and services is to gain profits and not just to solely satisfy the people&#8217;s needs and desires. The profit motive is responsible for the distribution of resources, determination of the character of the business, and leads to variations in production due to improved and increased technology.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Minimal Government Intervention:</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;Capitalist economic systems are characterized by minimal intervention by the government. Producers and consumers are at liberty to produce and buy goods and services respectively. Government intervention is limited to the protection of private property and the provision of public goods.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Consumer`s Sovereignty:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economy, a consumer is considered as a king. The whole production frameworks as per the directions of consumers. Utilization of resources, the technique of production, and the output, everything<strong> </strong>depends on impersonal force consumer&#8217;s demand. The consumers are at liberty to buy any goods and services as they need and desire. The choice of consumers is not subject to any restraint.</p>



<h4><strong>5. A Two-Class System:</strong></h4>



<p>Under the capitalist economic system, society is divided into two groups of individuals: The capitalist class and the Workers class.</p>



<p>The capitalist class owns the means of production and distribution and purchase the labor power of others. The capitalist class regulates the whole production and distribution process.&nbsp; While the workers class does not own any means of production. They sell their labor to the capitalist class in exchange for wages. However, there exists conflict between the two over the issues of wage payement, working hours, and working conditions. The worker&#8217;s class always remains subordinate to the capitalist class.</p>



<h4><strong>6. Willingness to Change:</strong></h4>



<p>Another character of a capitalist economy is its ability to adapt and change. It allows the change and adaptability of newer tastes of society. It does not stick to a single trend; it changes with the change in society to satisfy the demands of consumers. It also focuses on overcoming inefficiencies within its economic structure.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Advantages of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>In the Capitalist economic system, goods or services are distributed based on mechanisms set by societies, instead of government controls or mandates. The primary advantage of a Capitalist economy is that every individual has some sort of control over their fortune in life. The main benefit of the Capitalist economic system is that it provides strong incentives and motivation to grow, produce, innovate, improve, and move forward constructively. Some of the advantages of the capitalist economy are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>It  leads to innovation<em>:</em></strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy does create conditions for innovations to grow and thrive very quickly, for economic infrastructure to be built with maximum speed, making possible rapid development. &nbsp;Business owners invest in development and research to create better products. To get more profit every producer takes the new initiative to develop new techniques in production. The best example of innovation is the changing shapes and features of cellular mobile phones from hand handled mobile phones to pocket-size cellular phones.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>It is key to success:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Every person residing in a society focused on Capitalist economic systems does have an initial chance to find out success in many ways. Some may work even harder than others as everyone is surely going to get an opportunity at some level. There is one golden principle that if you work hard in your life, you have somehow a chance of reaching your definition of success.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>It  promotes participation:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy encourages people to get involved in all possible aspects of society to create the best outcome for themselves. People quickly get involved with different business activities so that they can get more and more benefits and create more capital.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Capitalist Economy embraces skills:</strong></h4>



<p>There are people with tremendous skills in this world that are not adequately utilized. A capitalist economy allows businesses to tap into these resources so that they can innovate. These innovations also create improving chances to continue for this developing world. This will undoubtedly bring an end to hunger, water scarcity, and other potentially life-threatening conditions.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>It leads to Economic Growth:</strong></h4>



<p>With the business firms and individuals facing incentives to be innovative, this creates a climate of innovation and therefore economic expansion. This in turn helps in an increase in real GDP and leads to improved living standards. In a capitalist economy, economic growth is faster and higher because the investor or the producer invests in the projects that are profitable to him. From a global perspective, before the industrial revolution, almost 80% of the world&#8217;s population lived in poverty. By 1980 that number had fallen to 34.8% and by 2000, less than 20% of the population lives on less than $1 a day. In the average country that became more capitalist over the last 25 years, the average citizen gained a 43% increase in income.</p>



<h4><strong>Disadvantages of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>Despite various merits and advantages of the capitalist economy, there are certain demerits of it. Some of which are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>More emphasis on the needs of business and not on the needs of the individual:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In a capitalist economy emphasis is more laid on the needs of the business rather than the needs of individuals. If companies want to remain operational, then they must introduce innovation in goods or services they offer and should also try to reduce costs. In a capitalist economy, there can be a misallocation of resources which results in higher production of luxury goods, which in turn will make the necessary goods more expensive and out of reach of an individual. Taking an example of some businesses (Telecom or IT or Pharmaceutical Companies, etc.) these are growing in this pandemic also but the common man is still striving for essentials.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Less government interference:</strong></h4>



<p>In a strong capitalist economic society, there is less or no interference of government and due to this the resources available are being utilized by few individuals to create opportunities and it leads to consolidation.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>People with disabilities are neglected:</strong></h4>



<p>The main focus of the Capitalist economy is too non-disabled individuals. If someone is unable to be productive, no matter what either because of injury or disability, they no longer have the ability to contribute and such individuals are left behind.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Competition is dragged into market:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy only focuses on the best. This means that larger businesses with more capital workforce smaller companies that lie out of their niches. It also means that workers with superior skills are forced out to work that usually may have an average based skillset.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Not bothered about the environment and other social structure:</strong></h4>



<p>The primary goal of the Capitalist economy is based mainly on consumption, so almost all of the energy is spent on that particular purpose alone. There is no consideration given to the environmental and social structures of the society, and no responsibility is shown so whatever harm may be done in another area.</p>



<h4><strong>Capitalist Economy Versus Social Economy</strong>:</h4>

Instead, the government—which owns or controls much of the economy&#8217;s resources—decides what’s, when’s, and how’s of production.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years, the capitalist economy has evolved. Starting with Feudalism followed by mercantilism and then capitalism. The capitalist economy needs a free market to succeed. Distribution of goods in a capitalist economic system is done according to laws of supply and demand.&nbsp; In a capitalist economy, the best products are generated for the best prices because consumers will pay more for what they want the most. The essential reward of a capitalist economy is the innovation of new products and more efficient production methods. The essential feature of capitalism is the motive to make a profit. In a capitalist economy, there is rational self-interest that can lead to economic growth. However, like anything else, a capitalist economy has its disadvantages too. No doubt that the capitalist economy has surpassed economic growth more than that of other economic systems, but the concentration of wealth in the hands of few always remains controversial. The forces that lead to the success of a capitalist economy may also act as a reason for its failure; it is necessary to take appropriate measures to protect the free market from powerful private interests.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>&nbsp;Education is one of the most important things in man’s life. It shapes the character of an individual and makes him able to distinguish between right and wrong. Education promotes individual freedom and dignity and provides for all-round personality. With education, a person discovers himself/herself in a place where he /she can look outside all around the world. A well-educated man is a more dependable worker, a better citizen, a center of wholesome influence, pride to his community, and honor to his country. The right to education is distinguished as a human right. The right to education is an inherent right. This right is to eliminate discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards of education, and to provide quality education. The Right to Education Act lays down responsibilities on the Centre, State, and local authorities for its proper implementation. India, as a nation is actively making various provisions for practical education to the children and youth across the country.</p>



<h4>Origin of Right to Education in India:</h4>



<p>The right to education in India has a vast history. Before independence, the education sector of India remained under the British rulers who did not do much for its development. At the end of the British rule literacy rate of India was 12%. India attained independence in 1947 and to bring a newly independent country in parallel to other developed nations, there was a lot of debate among the members of the constituent assembly. The constituent committee first proposed to include the right to Primary Education in Part III (Fundamental Rights) of the constitution, however, the advisory committee later rejected the proposal. It was then placed in the category of Directive Principles of State Policy.</p>



<p>As a result,<strong> the National Policy for Education (NPE)</strong> was declared in 1968 which has been made responsible for considerable expansion of education all over the country at all levels. However, due to a lack of financial and administrative support, gaps in implementation remained. In 1986 the government published a document that acted as a base for a new NPE. Even it was not able to bring adequate results.</p>



<p>Then in 2002, the 86th amendment to the constitution provided the Right to Education as Fundamental Right under Article 21-A. The same amendment provided for follow-up legislation that gave birth to the Right to Education Act (RET) 2009 and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) which was declared as apex monitoring authority of RTE. The government is committed to providing universal elementary education (primary and upper primary) for all children aged 6-14 years of age through its program called Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).</p>



<h4><strong>Law For Education In India:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The education</strong> system has been focused in India since the pre-independence period. However, since post-independence various efforts are being made to make the education system better. Different laws, policies, and programs have been introduced from time to time for the free and compulsory use of children. The landmark law for education in India is Right to Education (RTE) which was introduced in the year 2009 and came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> April 2010.</p>



<h4>Right to Education Act (RTE) 2009:</h4>



<p>The Right to Education Act provides free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14 years. This right enforces as Fundamental Right. Under this Act, it is mandatory to reserve 25% seats for the children belonging to disadvantaged sections of society which include scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, socially backward classes, and differently able children. This Act also set some standards for schools, which include pupil/teacher ratio, infrastructure, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Salient Features of RTE Act:</strong></p>



<p>1.  During elementary school, no child is required to submit any school fee or other stationery expenses.</p>



<p>2.  Punishments to children are forbidden. No teacher is allowed to inflict any corporal punishment or mental harassment on children.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be age-appropriate admission to children irrespective of their education level.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be separate toilets for the boys and girls in every school.</p>



<p>5.  No child should be detained up to elementary level.</p>



<p>6.  Curriculum should be devised as per the values enshrined in the constitution. It should ensure the all-round development of children.</p>



<p>7.  The teachers must be properly trained to impart education to elementary classes.</p>



<h4>Developments in Education Sector During Last Decade:</h4>



<p>Almost a decade ago, the government of India came up with a Right to Education (RTE) Act which made education a fundamental right and ensured free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years of age. Despite the structural loopholes and administrative lapses, the RTE Act has achieved success by realizing its prime objectives which include:</p>



<p><strong>1.  Increase in Enrollment:</strong></p>



<p>The RTE Act has successfully managed to increase enrollment of children in the elementary classes. As per the report, nationally, during 2009-2016, there has been a 19.4% increase in enrollment in elementary classes. The total enrollment stood at 927.2 % in schools in the year 2018[1].</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Improved Infrastructure Norms:</strong></p>



<p>The RTE Act has also achieved its objective of improved and proper infrastructure in schools. According to a report by ASER, the number of usable toilets has increased and has reached to 66.4% in 2018. There has been a significant increase in schools with boundary walls and kitchen shed. Also, an increase in the supply of books and other stationery items is observed in recent years.</p>



<p><strong>3.  Quality Education:</strong></p>



<p>Reports reveal that most of the states in India have adopted the curriculum as prescribed by the RTE Act. In schools (govt.), 80% of the teachers are professionally qualified to teach the children of elementary classes.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Adequate Girl Toilet Facilities:</strong></p>



<p>After the enforcement of the RTE Act, there has been an increase in the percentage of schools that are equipped with toilets for female children. Reports suggest that there has been an increase from 59% to 85% in the year 2018.</p>



<p><strong>5.  Maintenance of Pupil Teacher Ratio:</strong></p>



<p>There has been an increase in the number of teachers working in the government and aided schools which have resulted in a drop from 46% to 33% in the schools that don’t maintain the Pupil-Teacher Ratio.</p>



<h4>Shortcomings of Right to Education in India:</h4>



<p>The Right to Education (RTE) Act lacks teeth when it comes to enforcement of the provisions, the act suffers from some serious flaws. Some of them include:</p>



<p><strong>1.  No accountability:</strong></p>



<p>Right to Education Act, 2009 consists of 7chapters and 39 sections but not a single provision of this act deals with a penalty. There is no penalty for parents who deliberately don&#8217;t send their children to school and also no prescribed penalties for the government authorities which fail in discharging their respective duties under this Act.</p>



<p><strong>2.  Lack of policies and resources:</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;The government has not taken any major steps to enforce RTE. There is definitely a lack of resources and teachers. The share of schools that comply with the Right to Education guidelines has increased by a mere 3.7 percent during the last decade which is too low. The government is working very slowly in the implementation of the RTE Act. RTE Act 2009 fails to provide quality education to the children due to a lack of professionally qualified teachers.</p>



<p><strong>3.  Failure to provide full assistance:</strong></p>



<p>The 25% of seats reserved for EWS (economically weaker section) in private or unaided schools, even if the state paid for the tuition, who would pay for the rest? Who would pay for uniform, books, and the extra reading material, the dress for the annual day dance, the shoes, transport, and much more? This provision needs alteration and the state government should open its pockets to pay extra charges that the private schools are charging.</p>



<p><strong>4.  Socialization barriers for special abled children:</strong></p>



<p>This act contains a clause that motivates the elementary education of children with disabilities at home which is a good step but it leads to depression in children because such children are not able to socialize. The infrastructure of the schools doesn’t have adequate facilities for such children.</p>



<p><strong>5.  Another major flaw of the RTE Act,</strong> 2009 is that the act applies only to majority run schools; all minority educational run institutions are exempted from the provisions of this Act.</p>



<h4>Steps to Make Right to Education More Effective:</h4>



<p>Although the right to education has changed the education system in India yet there are many things to be done to make it more effective. Few steps which need to be taken include:</p>



<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Give incentives for schooling</strong>:</p>



<p>&nbsp;In poor families, kids are seen as helping hands, the more the better. They help in household chores and in the farm, besides earning money from labor jobs. Their contribution is quite significant for the survival of the family as a whole. Sending them to school takes this support away from the family. Hence, in order to educate them the following steps are an absolute necessity:</p>



<p>a)&nbsp; &nbsp; Monetary support to parents for sending kids to school.</p>



<p>b)&nbsp; &nbsp; Mid-day meal schemes etc.</p>



<p><strong>2.  Establish ownership and responsibility</strong>:</p>



<p>&nbsp;Particularly in the rural and poor areas, people’s representatives – MPs, MLAs, Sarpanchs’ – should be made responsible for the smooth functioning of the schools in their areas. Local relevant NGOs and other organizations may also be involved. They can provide support through the School Management Committees.</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>Focus on teacher training programs:</strong></p>



<p>The quality of teachers is the backbone of any teaching program. Untrained or unmotivated teachers can mar any program, no matter how ambitious it is. Creating a standard training program to train and generate quality teachers is crucial for the RTE Act to produce meaningful results.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Use computer and satellite technology to create awareness and interest:</strong></p>



<p>Create mobile units that pay visits to different schooling centers, particularly in remote areas, and show relevant films to both the teachers and the students. This will help sustain interest and arouse curiosity. Even visiting once in a fortnight or month would serve the purpose.</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong>  <strong>Easily accessible schools</strong>:</p>



<p>The Government should also focus on the construction of schools at an easily accessible distance. Traveling long distances to reach schools is the key factor for dropping out of school. The government should identify places near land dwellings so that children don’t face any troubles reaching schools.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong>  <strong>Awareness Campaigns:</strong></p>



<p>There must be more and more awareness among the common masses regarding the importance of education and the facilities available under the RTE Act.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Education undoubtedly remains the most important part of an individual. Knowledge brings prosperity to a nation. However, the nation as a whole is liable to provide for the proper provision and implementation of education in the country. India has recognized the right to education as a fundamental right for over a decade now, yet there remain primary loopholes that are responsible for its poor implementation. The primary fault of the RTE Act is its failure to recognize the main reason for the education crisis. The provisions of the RTE Act must be revisited with a view to making the education sector healthy and better. We need not write-off the RTE Act, 2009 as another failed legislation but should instead see it as a stepping stone to reform as per the people&#8217;s perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Open defecation is a human practice of defecating outside in a free environment. It has been defined as the practice of defecating in open fields, waterways, and open trenches without any proper disposal of human excreta. The method of open defecation is usually attributed to ancient times when there was no concept of toilets or due to less population, which exerted lesser pressure on surroundings. However, with the increase in population, the practice of open defecation led to some serious health and environmental issues. Due to development and urbanization, more attention was given to health, hygiene, and sanitation, which demanded the elimination of the practice of open defecation.<br>There have been many efforts made by various international bodies, including W.H.O and UNICEF to combat the practice of open defecation across the globe. These international bodies have conducted multiple surveys, prepared reports, and framed policies in order to help the nations across the world to overcome the practice of open defecation.</p>



<h4><strong>Why Do People Defecate in Open?</strong></h4>



<p>There have been many reasons for the human practice of open defecation. Generally, one may attribute this practice to poverty and lack of infrastructure, but there are other motivations for the people to go for the practice of open defecation. We have tried to classify the reasons for Toilet- related and Socio-cultural reasons.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Toilet- related reasons:</strong><br>Toilet related reasons include non- availability of toilets, broken toilets, non-availability of water near toilets, presence of men near toilets, bad smell inside toilets, safety and privacy concerns</li><li><strong>Socio-cultural reasons:</strong><br>Social-cultural motivations include lack of awareness, hesitant to change behavior, habitual of the practice, an act of socialization, preference of being in nature. Some people also say that the practice of open defecation was there during the time of god and goddesses, therefore to defecate inside toilets would go against their religious sentiments. While others believe that defecating in toilets near or inside houses bring bad smell and diseases.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>How is Open Defecation a Problem?</strong></h4>



<p>Open defecation is a taboo topic linked with a number of ill consequences. Emptying vessels in open space demand special attention because research has revealed its harmful effects. Few serious effects of defecating in open space are mentioned below under four heads, viz;<br>1) Health-Related Problems;2) Environmental degradation;<br>3) Attack on Human Dignity; and<br>4) Economic Disadvantages.</p>



<p><strong>1) Health-Related Problems:<br></strong>Defecating in open space induces a large number of flies, which act as disease carriers and spread several contagious diseases to human beings like, Diarrhea, Cholera, Typhoid, etc.. Due to lack of proper sanitation, children suffering from Diarrhea or Cholera or Typhoid, loose appetite, which results in malnutrition among them. The United Nations has reported that the countries where open defecation is practiced at a high rate have the highest number of deaths of children under the age of five because of open defecation. Practicing open defecation may also result in Kidney and bladder infections, as well as hookworm infection.</p>



<p><strong>2) Environmental Degradation:</strong><br>Practicing open defecation has Severeere impact on the environment as well. People, practicing open defecation, generally prefer riverside for nature’s call, which pollutes the river water causing water pollution. Open defecation is also the leading cause of groundwater contamination. Improperly disposed human wastes act as major soil polluters. Stink emitting from human disposal is also hideous and pollutes the surrounding air. Such places seduce large numbers of insects, which act as disease carriers and make the place dull.</p>



<p><strong>3) Attack on Human Dignity:</strong><br>Despite health and environmental impacts, open defecation has another grave and severe impact and that is loss of, human privacy and dignity, specifically for women and girls. The absence of private toilets put women and girls at the risk of sexual harassment and rape. Defecating openly makes them assailable to violence, and that acts as a clog to women empowerment and girl education.</p>



<p><strong>4) Economic Disadvantage:</strong><br>Apart from serious impacts on humans and the environment, the practice of open defecation also affects the economy of a particular country. It handicaps the economic development and growth of a nation. Defecating openly results in a decrease in productivity and the economy of a nation. Poor sanitation practices limit workers&#8217; productivity, longevity, and their ability to invest and save.</p>



<h4><strong>What is World Doing to Stop Open Defecation?</strong></h4>



<p>All the countries across the globe have geared up to combat the practice of open defecation. Different countries have come up with different ideas and policies for ending the practice of open defecation and for providing proper sanitation facilities to their citizens. International bodies like WHO, UNICEF, etc. are playing an active role to help countries across the globe to overcome open defecation. Some of them are:</p>



<p><strong>A) Sustainable Development Goals:</strong></p>



<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG`s) were prepared in 2015 by the UN General Assembly. The SDG 6.2 goal is to provide access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for every person. The SDG 6.2 goal mainly focuses on the elimination of the human practice of defecating in open space by 2030. This goal pays special attention to the sanitation and hygiene facilities of women and children. To pull the menace of open defecation from the bottom, by 2030, it is necessary that at least 60 million people should stop emptying their bowels in open space.</p>



<p><strong>B) Wash Program:</strong></p>



<p>UNICEF/ WHO and various other international bodies at present are conducting a Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) strategy. Over 100 countries out of which 26 high burden countries will be given special focus. These 26 countries are called “game plan countries&#8217; and these game plan countries put almost 90% of the global burden of open defecation. The target of UNICEF&#8217;s game plan is to eradicate open defecation from these 26 countries from its root. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under WASH is also trying to save the lives of people by improving and providing adequate sanitation.</p>



<p><strong>C) World Toilet Day:</strong></p>



<p>World Toilet Day is observed every year on 19th November. It is an official United Nations Observance day. World Toilet Day is celebrated to draw the attention of the world towards the issue of open defecation across the globe. It is used to raise awareness and inspire action to tackle the issue of sanitation crises across the globe.</p>



<p><strong>D) South Asia Conference on Sanitation:</strong></p>



<p>Regional consultations such as the South Asia Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN) are inspiring various advocacy campaigns and political commitment across south Asian countries to address the crisis of open defecation. During the last decade, there has been the greatest increase in the use of toilets. Sanitation revolution is blossoming across the region which is clearly visible in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.</p>



<p><strong>E) Sanitation and Water for All:</strong></p>



<p>Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) is a global partnership that is conducting high-level meetings at both the country, regional, and global levels to address the crisis of open defecation and ways to eliminate it. SWA mainly focuses on motivating and encouraging partners to increase sanitation and hygiene facilities and to ensure adequate financing for the same.<br>Apart from this, several nations are taking speedy steps to eliminate this danger out of their land as soon as possible and to declare themselves as “Open Defecation Free” (ODF).</p>



<h4><strong>Where Does the World Stand in Progress?</strong></h4>



<h4>Current Position:</h4>



<p>The current estimate is that around 12 percent of the global population is practicing open defecation. Despite a lot of efforts by national as well as international bodies, open defecation couldn’t be stopped. Out of 62 countries where almost 5% of the total population is practicing open defecation, only 16 countries are successful to defeat open defecation. However, the nations are still trying to achieve their target and declare themselves as Open defecation free.</p>



<h4>Decline During 2000-2017:</h4>



<p>As per the WHO report, between 2000 and 2017, there is a decline in open defecation rates in all SDG regions except Oceania. While Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand have already achieved the goal of elimination of open defecation, however in all other SDG regions at least 1% of the population still empty their bowels in open space. The largest fall in each SDG region was recorded in Ethiopia, Nepal, Cambodia, Sudan, Kiribati, and the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Countries that already reduced open defecation below 25% by 2000 progressed more slowly, accepting the challenges associated with the target of fully eliminating Open defecation, a total of 16 countries reduced open defecation by over 20 percentage points. Out of these 16 countries, five countries are able to stop open defecation up to 30% while two countries reduced open defecation by over 50 percentage points, as shown in the bar graph. Since 2000, one- third of Nepal’s and Lao People’s Democratic Republic&#8217;s population has been able to switch to toilets for the purpose of defecation. Nearly half of the population of India has stopped emptying their vessels (human excreta) in open space. Over half of the people of Ethiopia and Cambodia has successfully stopped the practice of open defecation. This indicates that people of these regions are giving more importance to the safety of public health than social norms. Data are given in a report which is prepared by WHO mentions that in 2017 almost 45% of the global population used a safely managed sanitation service, 31% of the global population used private sanitation facilities and 14% of the global population used toilets or latrines where human excreta were disposed of unaffected.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="448" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nC3t8dq0zD13kQ9qr1FAPwFzeSJnM7cfqozjULUGphM7LKadlAUzHxYBRAYuwT6fBPxrX9KreM41laLoaakwUmjAFRLquRXCsXh9YZ5p76Qa-A24HhhQxIHt3TlKs7hb5qfthQ"></p>



<h4><strong>What Needs to be Done to Stop Human Practice of Open Defecation?</strong></h4>



<p>Despite the progress made by the countries to be open defecation free, there are certain reports prepared by WHO which suggest that open defecation is still a menace that needs to be taken care of. As mentioned above out of 60 countries practicing open defecation, only 16 countries have shown positive results while other 44 counties still lag behind.<br>Now, the question that arises is, is it only the responsibility of the government of a particular nation to stop it<code>s</code> people from open defecation? Or are the citizens of a particular nation not responsible to help declare their nation as open defecation free? Or is building toilets and carrying sanitation programs the only possible way to curb this menace? Well, the answer to all these questions lies with the intention, capability, and capacity of the common masses of any nation. A nation is built not by its government or the policies of that government but by its nationals. When the nationals of that very particular state/nation take the oath to build their country clean and free from open defecation, there is no need to spend all the millions and billions of money for that purpose; rather the same money can be used for some other purpose. Like, as we see that globally people of underdeveloped or developing countries participate more in open defecation than developed countries, so the money that these underdeveloped or developing nations receive for sanitation purposes from international bodies. However, the same money can be used in developing the health sector, improved drinking water facilities, nutrition, education, for the protection of children and women, etc. In this way, not only a nation will be open defecation free, but it can develop in many folds.</p>



<h4>Individual Efforts:</h4>



<p>Also, someone has rightly said that charity begins at home, therefore, before suggesting others to stop this menace we all should first check that the same practice isn’t carried out in our own houses by any of our family members. And if done then all we must do is suggest them to stop and warn them about its bad repercussions.</p>



<h4>Community Efforts:</h4>



<p>Next comes the society where we live, we all prefer to live in a clean, healthy environment and for that, we all have to contribute a little. Every society has some norms and rules, and every person living in that society is supposed to follow these rules. Among these entire rules, the first and foremost rule should necessarily be not to defecate in an open space. A person living in a society has a reputation and is under societal pressure; therefore to maintain that reputation, he will surely follow the community rules. </p>



<h4>Efforts By Educational Institutions:</h4>



<p>In schools and also in higher educational institutions students should be given education-related to sanitation, and also the concept of open defecation free nations as a lot of people don&#8217;t know that such a thing even exists. A campaign should be started at the college level, where the students can inform the masses about proper sanitation, and the harmful consequences of open defecation.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>There is a clear difference in the attitudes of people towards emptying vessels. People besides cultural attitudes and social habits should make use of infrastructure considered safe and hygienic by environmental and health standards. The practice of defecating openly has very grave health impacts and concerns to women’s dignity. The matter of open defecation still continues in low and middle-income countries, where lack of resources and limited national budget towards sanitation has clogged the path to provide adequate sanitation facilities to the whole population. Open defecation is not a regional but a global issue that needs to be addressed speedily and effectively. We all can contribute to this cause by developing proper sanitation habits and educating others to do the same. The goal of an open defecation free (ODF) world is possible to achieve and that has been proven by many countries across the globe. Access to proper sanitation is the most essential component of human dignity, health, and well-being. <strong>In 2010 the UN General Assembly under a resolution recognized sanitation as a basic human right</strong>. Along with the obvious health benefits of ending open defecation, countries that have rid themselves of the practice have also enjoyed a huge transformation in social norms and a noticeable reduction in inequality.</p>
