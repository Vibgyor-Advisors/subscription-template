<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Punishment is the impulse used to authorize the tradition that must be adhered to which goes about as one of the segments of present-day human advancement. It is the obligation of the State to rebuff the crooks so as to keep up peace in the general public. Earlier, there wasn&#8217;t a particular law or request for such violations and the quantum and degree of punishment was to a great extent reliant on the King. With time present-day speculations of punishment were created and intentional accommodation of our privileges and capacity to keep up lawfulness was given to the state. The most severe or we can say the most noteworthy punishment granted in the present time is ‘Capital Punishment’.</p>



<p>Capital punishment is the punishment that includes the legitimate executing of an individual who has perpetrated specific wrongdoing restricted by the law. Capital punishment is also known as the ‘Death Penalty’ which is authorized by the legislature in which an individual is executed by the state as a punishment for the wrongdoing he submitted.</p>



<p>The debate about the death penalty is one of the endless debates of modern times. That it is endless is understandable, for there is death at both ends of the argument: the one who is to be killed at the hands of justice has himself killed, usually at the instigation of his own sense of justice, or (more commonly), injustice. And so, every argument about the preciousness, the sacredness, or the merely secular right to life can be answered with equal force from the other end. Small wonder then that the argument goes in a circle.</p>



<h4><strong>Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>The issue of capital punishment has been discussed, examined, concentrated from a delayed time yet till now no end can be drawn about the maintenance or abolishment of the arrangement. Capital punishment has been a method of punishment for centuries which is rehearsed for the disposal of criminals and is utilized as the discipline for the previous violations.</p>



<p>India is one of the retentionist countries which have retained the death penalty. In India deciding the case for the death penalty is based on the doctrine of ‘rarest of the rare test’ which was stated in the case of Bachan Singh v. the State of Punjab, [i] which means that the death penalty should be awarded in rarest of rare cases. This view of the Supreme Court was highly supported as it aimed to reduce the use of Capital Punishment.</p>



<p>The rationale for the decision applied by the Supreme Court on account of Bachan Singh is that capital punishment is constitutional only if it goes about as an option in contrast to life detainment.&nbsp; Furthermore, the same will be applied in rarest of the rare case at the point when the elective choice of life imprisonment is unquestionable dispossessed.</p>



<p>There has been a differing supposition with respect to capital punishment in India as some are in the opinion of the maintenance of the discipline while others are in the opinion of its abolishment. The individuals who are in the opinion of capital punishment contend that it ought to be given in the most grievous and rarest of the rare violations. However, the individuals who are against the death penalty contend on the religious, good, and moral grounds and announce it inhumane. It is additionally proposed that it ought to be supplanted with life detainment or any substitute must be brought out.</p>



<p><strong>The Constitution of India under Article 21 states</strong> that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. On account of capital punishment when the punishment of death is granted then it additionally restricts the extent of presentation of new realities or laws for the situation. On the off chance that the punishment has been executed, it is permanent.</p>



<h4><strong>Constitutional Validity of Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>The established constitutional validity of capital punishment was tested every once in a while, in various cases beginning from Jagmohan Singh <em>v. </em>State of Uttar Pradesh [ii] where the Supreme Court dismissed the contention that capital punishment is the infringement of the &#8220;right to life&#8221; which is ensured under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.</p>



<p>For another situation, in Rajendra Prasad<em> v. </em>State of Uttar Pradesh, [iii] Justice Krishna Iyer has compassionately focused on that capital punishment is violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21, but year a later in the milestone case of Bachan Singh v. the State of Punjab, [iv] by a dominant majority of 4:1 (Bhagwati J. disagreeing) the Supreme Court overruled its previous decision in Rajendra Prasad case. It communicated the view that capital punishment, as an elective punishment for murder isn&#8217;t absurd and thus violative of Articles 14,19, and 21, of the Constitution of India, in light of the fact that the &#8220;public order&#8221; contemplated by Clauses (2) to (4) of Article 19 is unique in relation to &#8220;law and order&#8221; and furthermore articulated the standard of granting capital punishment just in the &#8220;rarest of rare cases&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly in various other cases, the Supreme Court has given its perspectives on capital punishment and on its established legitimacy. The Supreme Court in Machhi Singh v. the State of Punjab, [v] set out the expansive frameworks of the conditions when capital punishment ought to be imposed.</p>



<p>It is noteworthy to mention that the dissenting judge in the <em>Bachan Singh case, Justice Bhagwati, found the death penalty necessarily arbitrary, discriminatory and capricious. He reasoned that the death penalty in its actual operation is discriminatory, for it strikes mostly against the poor and deprived sections of the community, and the rich and the affluent usually escape, from its clutches. This circumstance also adds to the arbitrary and capricious nature of the death penalty and renders it unconstitutional as being violative of Articles 14 and 21. [vi] However, the majority of the judges, in this case,</em> didn’t agree with this opinion and held capital punishment constitutionally valid.</p>



<h4><strong>Penological Justification for the Death Penalty</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Deterrence</strong></li></ul>



<p>Deterrence aims to prevent individuals from offending by using the fear or threat of punishment [vii]. The assumption behind deterrence theory is that all persons are rational individuals, and will commit a crime only if they perceive that the gain they will derive from the criminal act will be greater than the pain they will suffer from its penal consequences.[viii] The idea is that the activity of deterrence is reinforced when the punishment is made as extreme as death itself; no individual in his/her correct attitude would submit a demonstration which may bring about the loss of one&#8217;s life, the nature of self-protection being inherent, biological and invincible under common conditions.</p>



<p>For deterrence to work, it is necessary that certain prerequisites be met. If anyone of these prerequisites does not exist, or if any of them are weakened, then the overall idea of deterrence fails. These prerequisites can be broadly articulated as follows [ix]:</p>



<ol><li>That potential offenders know which offenses merit the death penalty.</li><li>That potential offenders conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits before or while committing the crime and weigh the death penalty as a serious and important cost.</li><li>That potential offenders view it as a probable consequence that they will be subjected to the death penalty if they commit the crime.</li><li>That potential offenders are risk-averse and not risk-seeking.</li><li>That potential offenders give more weight to the costs than the benefits and choose to not perform the act.</li></ol>



<p>If all the above-mentioned prerequisites are met, then it is assumed that the potential offender will be deterred from offending. However, experts noticed two major fallacies in these assumptions &#8211; Knowledge Fallacies and Rationality Fallacies.</p>



<p>Knowledge fallacies refer to the idea that offenders <em>do not know </em>the penalties applicable to the crimes that they plan on committing. Hence, they do not feel deterred by a severe penalty.</p>



<p>A major assumption of deterrence theory is that potential offenders are rational decision-makers. However, a large number of crimes are committed in a fit of rage or anger, or when the offender is clinically depressed, or are motivated out of strong emotions such as revenge or paranoia. In circumstances such as these, deterrence is unlikely to operate since the actor is not likely to give due weight or even a cursory consideration to what penalties might be imposed on him/her subsequently; the focus is on the emotion driving his/her state of mind. [x]</p>



<p>The discussion above does not imply that deterrence is a myth and the criminal justice system could do away with all punishments entirely, without impacting deterrence. Indeed, the fact that there exists<em> </em>a criminal justice system that punishes criminal conduct is by itself a deterrent. Consequently, it is not necessary that punishments by themselves be harsh or excessive. Theorists argue that the assumption in criminal law that the harsher the punishment, the less likely it is to be committed is not true.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incapacitation</strong></li></ul>



<p>The theory of incapacitation advocates dealing with offenders in such a way that they are not in a position to re-offend. It is generally used as a justification to impose longer sentences on repeat offenders, dangerous criminals, or career criminals. To be able to use the incapacitation rationale, it is essential that the sentencing court make an assessment of the ‘dangerousness’ of the offender and the possibility that the person is likely to re-offend.</p>



<p>The primary objection to executing a person on grounds of incapacitation is the predictability problem. It is virtually impossible to be able to predict if the convicted offender is likely to re-offend. Capital punishment is the most extreme form of incapacitation since it implies taking the life of the offender to ensure that he/she does not re-offend.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reformation</strong></li></ul>



<p>The theory of reformation strives to transform all offenders into peaceful, productive, and capable citizens of society. Reformation assumes that offenders are capable of change, and once the reasons for the commission of the crime are removed, they can lead ordinary and fulfilling lives.</p>



<p>While it is clear that when a person is sentenced to death, the idea of reformation has clearly lost its priority in sentencing, discussions of reformation have often been a part of death penalty adjudication. This is because reformation is a central normative commitment of our criminal justice system, and because only those offenders who are adjudged beyond reform and proven to be so, through conclusive evidence adduced by the prosecution, can ever be sentenced to death.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Public Opinion</strong></li></ul>



<p>An important reason often cited by governments for retaining the death penalty is that public opinion demands the same. One could argue that public opinion is indeed a factor to be considered while making important decisions that affect the population at large. However, it is not necessary for the government to follow public opinion on every issue.</p>



<p>The Indian experience of laws governing social issues, such as Sati, dowry prohibition, untouchability, and child marriage is a testament to the fact that the government has the power to lead public opinion even against deeply entrenched cultural norms and indeed an obligation to do so when faced with issues concerning human dignity and equality.</p>



<h4><strong>Contemporary Reports commenting on Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>Recent expansions of the scope of the death penalty, for example, passed in 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act introduced several new provisions into the Indian Penal Code, including Section 376A, which allowed for the death penalty to be imposed in cases where rape led to the death of the victim or left her in a persistent vegetative state; and 376E which allowed for the imposition of the death penalty for certain repeat offenders. These amendments were passed in the wake of the recommendations of the Verma Committee.[xi] Pertinently, while the Verma Committee was in favor of enhanced punishment for certain forms of sexual assault and rape, it noted that “in the larger interests of society, and having regard to the current thinking in favor of the <em>abolition of the death penalty, and also to avoid the argument of any sentencing arbitrariness, we are not inclined to recommend the death penalty.</em>” The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, nevertheless expanded the scope of the death penalty.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>India’s Law Commission in its 262<sup>nd</sup> Report (August 2015) </strong>recommended that the concept of the death penalty should be abolished for all crimes other than terrorism-related offenses to safeguard national security.</p>



<p>The Law Commission in its past report in the year 1967, Commission finished up that India couldn&#8217;t change the &#8220;analysis of abrogation of the death penalty&#8221;. However, in 2015 the Commission expressed that &#8220;the Commission feels that the time has arrived for India to move towards abrogation of capital punishment&#8221;. Further, it was mentioned, “The social, economic and cultural contexts of the country have changed drastically since the 35<sup>th</sup> Report” (1967).</p>



<p>Moreover, arbitrariness has remained a major concern in the adjudication of death penalty cases in the past years since the foremost precedent on the issue was laid down.</p>



<h4><strong>Rate of Execution and Commutation of Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>In India, the concept of the death penalty is present but there were only 11 executions done from the year 1998-2019. In the last 20 years, a total of 3751 death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment.</p>



<p>After handing out 186 death sentences in 2018 — a 20-year high — the number of capital punishments given out at trial courts in 2019 declined sharply to 102.</p>



<p>There is a clear focus on the perpetrators of sexual crimes as particularly “deserving” of the death penalty. However, there is no evidence that adding the death penalty for rape under certain circumstances has acted as a deterrent. In fact, the number of rape-murders increased between 2017 and 2018. [xii]</p>



<p>Data gathered by the National Crimes Record Bureau on death sentences indicates that in the period between 2000 and 2012, <strong>1677 death sentences were imposed by Indian courts</strong>. This implies that India sends on average 129 persons to death row every year, or roughly <strong>one person every third day. </strong>This number is alarmingly high and appeared to suggest that the death penalty is being applied much more widely than was envisaged by the Bachan Singh case.</p>



<h4><strong>The Fallibility of the Criminal Justice System and the Death Penalty</strong></h4>



<p>In the last decade, the Supreme Court has on numerous occasions expressed concern about arbitrary sentencing in death penalty cases.</p>



<p>In Rampalb Pithwa Rahidas v. the State of Maharashtra, [xiii] where the trial court sentenced 8 persons to death and the high court confirmed the death sentence against 5 of them, the Supreme Court acquitted all the accused, on the ground that the main evidence against them – that of an approver – was not reliable.</p>



<p>So also, in Subash Chander &amp; others <em>v. </em>Krishan Lal &amp; others, [xiv] where the trial court convicted the four accused and sentenced three of them to death, and the High Court upheld the conviction but commuted the sentence of all to life, the Supreme Court acquitted all the accused.</p>



<p>Again, in Parmananda Pegu v. the State of Assam, [xv] the lower courts had imposed the death sentence on the accused while the Supreme Court acquitted the accused.</p>



<p>The above-mentioned cases and many more like these stand the question that each judge can only limit his analysis to the cases he has presided over or read about. In light of the large volumes of cases, the determination that one or the other case is a “rarest of rare case” would remain nothing but a legal fiction. Whether a law that permits the taking of life on the basis of legal fiction, is in consonance with the text and spirit of the Constitution, bears investigation.</p>



<p>It is noteworthy to mention here that anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to appeal to a court of higher jurisdiction, and steps should be taken to ensure that such appeals shall become mandatory. Also, Clemency powers in India are enshrined in the Constitution. Article 72 vests these powers in the President, and Article 161 vests similar powers in the Governors of the States. Clemency powers mean either pardoning the offender or reducing or altering the punishment awarded by the Court.</p>



<h4><strong>International Trends and Deterrence</strong></h4>



<p>Today, 106 countries had abolished the death penalty in law for all crimes by the end of 2017 and 142 countries had abolished the death penalty in law or practice. [xvi] A category of countries has also abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes such as murder and retained it for exceptional crimes such as crimes under military law or under exceptional circumstances.</p>



<p>When a death penalty is awarded it eliminates the scope of improvement which could have changed the life of an individual, this is the reason why democracies around the world are supporting the reformative theory of punishment and abolishing the deterrent theory of punishment. The death penalty is most prominently used in Iran, China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, and the USA.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The death penalty does not serve the penological goal of deterrence any more than life imprisonment. Further, life imprisonment under Indian law means imprisonment for the whole of life subject to just remissions which, in many states in cases of serious crimes, are granted only after many years of imprisonment which range from 30-60 years.</p>



<p>Retribution has an important role to play in punishment. However, it cannot be reduced to vengeance. The notion of ‘an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth’ has no place in the constitutionally mediated criminal justice system. Capital punishment fails to achieve any constitutionally valid penological goals.</p>



<p>In focusing on the death penalty as the ultimate measure of justice to victims, the restorative and rehabilitative aspects of justice are lost sight of. Reliance on the death penalty diverts attention from other problems ailing the criminal justice system such as poor investigation, crime prevention, and rights of victims of crime.</p>



<p>In retaining and practicing the death penalty, India forms part of a small and ever-dwindling group of nations. That 142 countries are now abolitionist in law or in practice, demonstrates that evolving standards of human dignity and decency do not support the death penalty. The international trend towards successful and sustained abolition also confirms that retaining the death penalty is not a requirement for effectively responding to the insurgency, terror, or violent crime.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>In India, no doubt there are special laws relating to children but still, they are deprived of even basic human rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of India and other legislation. In India, the problem of child labour is quite alarming. As per Census 2011, the total child population in India in the age group (5-14) years is 259.6 million. Of these, 10.1 million (3.9% of total child population) are working, either as ‘main worker’ or as ‘marginal worker’. In addition, more than 42.7 million children in India are out of school. [i]</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Child labour deprives the child of an opportunity for education, play, and recreation. It affects physical growth, normal development, and prevents their preparation for responsibility. There are a number of risks that are experienced by working children. The worst effect of child labour is that it interferes with the education of the children which decreases their vocational development. They neither acquire any skill nor receive any education as a result they remain illiterate and oppressed. Most of all it gives birth to a number of economic problems such as the use of labour at its lowest productivity implying thereby an inefficient utilization of labor-power.</p>



<p>The most affected aspect of working children is their health. The working children are more vulnerable to tuberculosis and bronchitis, muscle atrophy, weakening and malformation of bones, eye diseases, stunted growth, finger arthritis, damage to fingernails, and malnutrition.</p>



<p>The worst forms of child labour which include slavery and similar practices like trafficking, forced labour, etc. have severe effects on children like depression, premature aging, malnutrition, and drug dependency. It endangers the child‘s dignity and morals. It endangers their innocence.</p>



<h4><strong>Constitutional Safeguards in India for Children</strong></h4>



<p>Keeping in view the gigantic problem of child labour, the Indian Parliament enacted appropriate laws for protecting children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is, in a way, likely to be hazardous or harmful to their health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. The Constitution of India has enough provisions in this regard.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Article 15(3)</strong> of the Constitution authorizes the state for making any special provision for women and children. </li><li><strong>Article 21 </strong>provides, no person shall be deprived of his life or his personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. </li><li><strong>Article 21A</strong> says the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6-14 years in such manners as the State may, by law, determine. </li><li><strong>Article 23</strong> says traffic in human beings and the beggar and other forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this position shall be an offense punishable in accordance with the law. </li><li>Under <strong>Article 24</strong> no child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. </li><li><strong>Article 39(E)</strong> says the State shall make its policy towards securing the health and strengths and the tender age of children are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength. Article 39 (E) enjoins that childhood and youth are to be protected against exploitation, against moral and material abandonment. </li><li>In <strong>Article 45</strong> the Constitution provides free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years. </li><li>The general provisions under<strong> Article 38, 42, 43, 45, and 47 of Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>, although do not deal directly with child welfare but provide a strategy for indirectly promoting the welfare of children.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Legislative Provisions for Protection of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Notwithstanding the abovementioned constitutional provisions, there are a number of enactments in the country which protect and safeguard the interests of child labour.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Factories Act of 1881</strong> was the first law to define children and to prescribe prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 7 years of age. The Factories Act, 1911 prohibited employment of children in dangerous occupations and working during night hours. The first Convention of International Labour Organisation (ILO), compelled amendment of the Act in 1922, to raise the minimum age of a child to 15 years. However, children below the age of 12 years were prohibited from employment. The age rose to 13 years in 1935 under the Act. </li><li><strong>The Factories Act, 1948</strong>, prescribes prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 14 years of age in any factory. </li><li><strong>India Mines Act, 1952 </strong>prohibits employment of children below 16 years in any underground mines.</li><li><strong>Plantation Labour Act, 1951 </strong>prohibits employment less than the age of 12 years<strong>. </strong></li><li><strong>The Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961 </strong>absolutely prohibits the employment of children in motor transport. </li><li><strong>The Shops and Commercial Establishments Acts of different States, </strong>also prohibit employment of children in the shops, hotels, dhabas, street shops, and commercial places. </li><li><strong>Besides the above legislations, The Apprentice Act, 1961, </strong>The Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966, The Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 provide that employment of children is a punishable offense. </li></ul>



<p>As required by ILO Convention and as envisaged in the National Seminar on Employment of Children in 1975, to prevent exploitation of children, the Indian Government felt to enact a single Act to deal with the prohibition of child labour.</p>



<h4><strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act</strong></h4>



<p>To provide uniformity of age and to prescribe stricter punishments, the Indian Parliament enacted a single Act to deal with the exploitation of children,<em> i.e.</em>, <strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986</strong>. The Act prohibited the employment of children below the age of 14 years in certain occupations and processes. These include the transport of passengers, goods, and mails and other hazardous work in railways and ports, the process like Beedi making, cement manufacturing, manufacturing of matches and explosives, mica cutting, soap manufacturing, wool cleaning, and building and construction industries. The Act also provides for regulations of conditions of work by prescribing minimum working hours, prohibiting work at night, prohibiting overtime work, and weekly holiday. Also, the Act provides measures for the health and safety of child workers. It emphasized the maintenance of a register having details of children if employed by any organization. Indirect support was extended for such an evil practice which should be totally prohibited irrespective of the nature of employment. <strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012</strong>, has several features that are child-centered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Act tried to fill the gaps which existed due to earlier Acts. However, this Act also proved to be ineffective in curbing the problem. As per UNICEF (2011), the number of child labourers in India is 10.1 million of which 5.6 million are boys and 4.5 million are girls [ii]. Thus, with modernization, the Government of India tried to keep pace with changing times where child labour has included many other forms of exploitation and the government brought an amendment in 2016 which brought many changes in the Act. Some major changes were –</p>



<ul><li>While the original act allowed the employment of children above 14 years in hazardous occupations and processes, the Amendment banned the employment of children at such places up to the age of 18 years.</li><li>The Amendment calls for stricter punishments for violations.</li><li>While the Act prohibited the employment of children up to 14 years in specified categories such as domestic work, automobile workshops, and other hazardous industries; the Amendment gives certain exceptions where the children of such age are allowed to work, like in sporting activities but only in non-school hours and without a subordinate relationship of work and labour. The government justified the exceptions to strike a balance between the need for education for children and the reality of the socio-economic condition and social fabric in the country. But, this Amendment was criticized for taking away the basic protections for some of the most vulnerable workers, and some well-known child rights activists while criticizing the new Amendment say that it permits children to be confined to work instead of being in school because allowing children to work before and after school creates an imbalance in their lives and the children cannot be expected to do multi-tasks at such a tender age and as a result, they are forced to give up their education.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>C</strong>hallenges</h4>



<p>Despite such legislation and rights guaranteed by the Constitution, India continues to be among the countries which have the highest percentage of child labour. The main reasons for this are the economic condition of India, the imbalance that exists in its societies, and most of all the weak implementation mechanisms. In addition to these reasons are, namely:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Poverty &#8211;</strong> It is the single important reason for child labour. The poor parents in order to supplement their income allow the children to work even on unremunerative jobs. Abject poverty and unemployment force the children to take up unremunerative jobs. Thus, economic compulsions weigh heavily on the consciousness of the poor parents and they would not mind colluding with their children’s employers in violating the laws and putting their children under the risks of inhuman exploitation. Parents want their children to earn for themselves as early as possible, much better, if they become a source of income to the family. </li></ul>



<p>Even the highest court of the country has observed that the child labour in India is purely on account of economic reasons that the parents often want their children to be employed to augment their meager earnings and this problem cannot be solved by mere legislation because of the poverty and destitution in the country. In order to eradicate this problem, it is essential that a child should have been able to receive proper education with a view to equipping itself to become a useful member of society and to play a constructive role in the socio-economic development of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Loss of an earning member of the family.</li><li>The poor conviction rate of the violators.</li><li>Many employers prefer to engage children because they are cheap. Moreover, children tend to be less troublesome, more disciplined, and highly adaptable.</li><li>Absence of any state-sponsored scheme of family allowance.</li><li>Nonexistence of any general scheme of compulsory education up to a minimum age.</li><li>The evasion of existing laws for the protection of children.</li><li>Even the social structure system is responsible for child labour as the social structure is characterized by the caste system. The members of the low castes and down-trodden communities are expected to be for the services of the upper castes and thus, they are deprived of their aspirations.</li></ul>



<p>The problem of child labour in India is deeply rooted in the exploitative socio-economic set-up and poor and backward economy. Ignorance by people, lack of opportunities, and other socio-economic institutions add to this problem.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>No doubt there are a number of legislations and constitutional safeguards for child welfare to overcome child labour and to avoid the situations that come as a consequence of child labour. At an international level, different organizations are also working for the same cause. But still, there are a lot of efforts needed to create an environment that is free from child abuse. The instances discussed in the various sections of the writing indicate how far India is in eradicating child labour and how hard work it needs to do for the welfare of the poor, ignorant, and unheard children. The problem lies in the implementation side. The States should devise effective mechanisms for the proper implementation of laws. The more responsibility lies on the parents who should not force their children to indulge in such occupations. Awareness building programs shall be conducted with parents and communities through which people at large can understand the ill-effects of child labour. This problem needs the support of every person in the society and we should discourage the people to employ children in factories, homes, shops, etc. and the initiatives of the civil societies also need to be appreciated.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>People whose gender identity lies beyond or between the categories of women and men – or who live and love outside the norms of heterosexuality – have been agents of change and builders of community throughout history and around the world. Across cultures and social strata, sexual and gender minorities are family members, workers, policy-makers, peacebuilders, soldiers, refugees, and ordinary people. The struggle for recognition and rights for the LGBTQ+ community has strengthened with wider movements for social justice, and the safe spaces they have forged amidst adversity have served as sites of tolerance and solidarity in often difficult times. Nonetheless, sexual and gender minority populations and communities continue to face violence and discrimination, in both conflict and peace, owing to the social norms and attitudes that denigrate their humanity and render them vulnerable.</p>



<h4><strong>System of Violence and Discrimination</strong></h4>



<p>In many societies, discrimination means that states fail to provide for the security needs of sexual and gender minority persons, leaving them in a position of vulnerability. In terms of survival mechanisms, many sexual and gender minority individuals are forced to hide their gender identity vis-à-vis other members of society and, where possible, rely on clandestine networks of trust and mutual support. Several countries still criminalize same-sex relations, but it is everyday discrimination and violence that might be the most urgent problem for LGBTQ persons. Sexual and gender minority individuals experience forced institutionalization in mental rehabilitation clinics, electroshock treatment as aversion therapy, sexual harassment in school and at work, threats of rape to make you straight, school expulsions, eviction by landlords, police kidnapping, family violence, and media stigmatization. Sexual and gender minorities face discrimination in the workplace because of their gender and their sexual orientation. Employment and job promotions are denied if women look too masculine. Male co-workers stalk and sexually harass lesbians who cannot report for fear of backlash and retaliation. Transgender variant people are marginalized in their jobs and are targeted for blackmail, harassment, and sexual violence from the community or people in positions of authority like the police. Activists who defend the rights of LGBTQ people experience threats to their safety, in some cases, harassment, attacks, even torture, and abuse, with police participating in or doing nothing to stop these violations.<strong>[i]</strong></p>



<p>Discrimination and harassment in workplaces, being denied stable employment or housing, not obtaining identity cards that indicate their chosen gender are some more issues facing the LGBTQ community. The cultural pressures and importance of family life are however the greatest obstacle. “The family unit is arguably the greatest influence on the lives of LGBTQ people, yet acceptance by families is limited by strong cultural pressures.”<strong>[ii]</strong></p>



<p>International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) reports that those who challenge sexual or gender norms often confront violence in the “private” sphere of the family. The threat of family or community rejection or recrimination often prompts people to lead double lives, making them vulnerable to police blackmail and extortion. Queer and transgender persons and other gender non-conforming people and communities face hostility, discrimination, and abuse in most places.</p>



<h4><strong>Forms of Violence and Discrimination</strong></h4>



<p>Some of the forms of violence and discrimination that sexual and gender minority individuals and communities face in conflict and peacetime can be categorized as follows:</p>



<ol><li>&nbsp;Targeted violence, including killing and sexual violence;</li><li>&nbsp;Policing of gender norms;</li><li>Blackmail and extortion; and&nbsp;</li><li>Rejection by family and other community members.</li></ol>



<p>We use this division for the sake of classification, but the differentiation between these forms of violence is somewhat forced, as in practice many of these forms occur simultaneously and/or one form might lead to another.</p>



<h4><strong>Targeted Violence against Sexual and Gender Minority Persons</strong></h4>



<p>Armed groups of very different ideological persuasions have used targeted violence like murder, against sexual and gender minority persons. The most systematic targeting was arguably that by Nazi Germany, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and trans persons from 1933 to 1945.<strong>[iii]</strong> </p>



<p>Syria and Iraq are currently among the prime groups in which targeted violence against sexual and gender minority people is most pronounced and visible. The violence committed by Islamic State, which includes the sentencing and the alleged execution of gay men by throwing them off buildings as well as targeted violence against lesbian women, has gained the most international prominence. However, other militias as well as state security forces have also targeted sexual and gender minority individuals, including specifically lesbian women in Iraq and Syria for persecution, violence, and murder.<strong>[iv]</strong></p>



<p>Nonetheless, it is not only those self-identifying as a sexual and gender minority person who is targeted. Iraqi men accused of being ‘effeminate’ and women accused of being too masculine (and therefore suspected of being gay or lesbian), based on their mannerisms, sartorial style, haircut or the like, faced violence including death, from family and community members, state security forces and militias such as the League of the Righteous (Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq) and the Mahdi Army (Jaish al-Mahdi).<strong>[v]</strong></p>



<p>Asa&#8217;ib Ahl al-Haq is an Iraqi Shi&#8217;a political party and paramilitary group active in the Iraqi insurgency and Syrian Civil War and the Mahdi Army, also known as the Jaysh al-Mahdi, is a Shiite militia which rose to international prominence in 2004 when it spearheaded the first major armed confrontation against the US forces in Iraq from the Shia community.</p>



<p>It is difficult to evaluate the degree of oppression that LGBTQ persons face in various countries in the region as there is a lack of reliable data. In Cambodia, homophobic attacks and abuse are reported in public places such as markets and clubs and in community settings.</p>



<h4><strong>Legal, Social and Ideological Frameworks of Exclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The vulnerability of sexual and gender minority communities and individuals to violence and discrimination is underpinned by legal, social, and ideological narratives and forms of exclusion, which may reduce or deny them access to the services or rights provided to other citizens. In fragile and conflict-affected states where services are often limited from the start, sexual and gender minority persons are left in one of the most vulnerable positions in society. In countries where same-sex activities are illegal, reporting sexual and gender-based violence to the police can put the victim/survivor in the position of the criminal. As of 2019, some 77 countries have laws that criminalize same-sex sexual practices, some going as far as to criminalize identities, in particular trans identities, as well as acts.<strong>[vi] </strong></p>



<p>These laws expose people who are already socially marginalized within heteronormative societies to arrest and prosecution for consensual sexual activities and their gender expressions. Criminal laws against homosexuality or other forms of non-normative sexuality also protect the perpetrators of homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic violence by restricting the ability of their victims to file complaints or press charges. Even where such laws are not enforced, as in Nigeria where a moratorium currently stands on the use of the death penalty for those convicted of homosexual acts, the existence of those laws nonetheless constitutes a form of “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” and legitimizes persecution.<strong>[vii]</strong> </p>



<p>Wherever they exist, such laws can be and at times are held over the heads of sexual and gender minority people, used not only to prosecute them but also to marginalize, blackmail, and extort them.</p>



<h4><strong>Extra-legal Harassment and Violence</strong></h4>



<p>In addition to legal criminalization and excessive use of punishment and detention, sexual and gender minority communities frequently face extra-legal harassment and violence from state security actors including police and militaries. Even in the regions of Russia, gay men claimed that they were abducted and tortured by authorities in Chechnya amid what rights groups call a brutal “purge” targeting sexual minorities in the Russian region.<strong>[viii] </strong></p>



<p>In several Eastern European countries, bombs have destroyed gay bars and right-wing parties have attacked homosexuals. A bomb exploded outside a gay club in the capital of Latvia in February 1995, for instance, and the main suspect was a member of an extremist party that called for action against homosexuals. At least 20 people were injured when the Czech Republic&#8217;s first-ever Gay Pride parade was attacked by right-wing extremists armed with tear gas in 2008.<strong>[ix] </strong></p>



<p>In Orlando, Florida a gunman attacks a gay nightclub in 2016 leaving 50 dead.<strong>[x]</strong> </p>



<p>A lack of police protection only encourages such violence. Government disregard for anti-LGBT violence is particularly blatant in Latin America. Often, the murders of gay men are labeled as “sex crimes” by the authorities, as with the 1998 murder of a prominent activist in Romania and of killings of five well-known Mexican gay men in July 1992. Equally as common is an inadequate investigation. In addition, more than 445 LGBT Brazilians died as victims of homophobia in 2017<strong>[xi]</strong></p>



<p>Homosexuals are a prime target for continuous attacks, killings, theft, blackmail, and extortion because they are still more afraid of the police than they are of the bandits. The Blue Diamond Society (BDS), which provides advocacy and assistance to sexual and gender minority people in Nepal, has noted that increases in violence against people who fall outside normative gender and sexual identities are “directly linked to the increased mobilization of military and police given the critical security situation in the country.”<strong>[xii]</strong> </p>



<p>In spite of anti-harassment regulations in the Nepali armed forces, there have been individual cases of discrimination reported against allegedly lesbian soldiers.<strong>[xiii]</strong></p>



<p>Similarly, in South Africa, some lesbian cadres in the armed wing of the African National Congress, the <em>uMkhonto we Sizwe</em>, the armed wing of the African National Congress, co-founded by Nelson Mandela in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre,[xiv] was subjected to sexual harassment, abuse, and violence by their male comrades, even was official there was a commitment to diversity.<strong>[xv]</strong></p>



<p>Globally, the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (UN OHCHR) has noted widespread assault and torture perpetrated by security forces against people identified as gay or transgender, including violence that particularly targets the features marking them as different. In a 2012 report, the UN OHCHR documented cases where trans women had been beaten on their breasts and cheekbones, where they had surgical implants, to release toxins. In Uganda and Lebanon, police and army officers have routinely extorted sexual and gender minority refugees who engage in sex work for sexual services, with threats of harm, deportation, or public outing. <strong>[xvi]</strong></p>



<h4><strong>What Policies Can Improve LGBT+ Inclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The United Nations Human Rights Council, in a defining vote, adopted a resolution on June 30, 2016, on “Protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation, and gender identity,” to mandate the appointment of an independent expert on the subject.<strong>[xvii] </strong></p>



<p>It was a historic victory for the human rights of anyone at risk of discrimination and violence because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lately, India’s highest court decision to strike down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial-era law banning gay sex, was a watershed victory in the fight for human rights. Progress like these, naturally, does not happen in a vacuum. India’s verdict directly referenced Nepal’s landmark ruling in 2007, which resulted in legal protection for LGBT+ individuals, as well as official recognition of a third gender. In subsequent years, similar legislation acknowledging a third gender was enacted in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India. Moreover, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have allowed people to change their legal gender.<strong>[xviii]</strong></p>



<p>However, discrimination and abuse against the LGBT+ community are still prevalent in the region. Decriminalization of homosexuality is only the first step of many in the battle for civil rights and wider acceptance.<strong>[xix]</strong></p>



<p>Ensuring that LGBT+ individuals can openly express their sexual orientation and gender identity without being stigmatized, discriminated against, or attacked should be a policy priority, for at least three reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The first and most important reason is obviously ethical.</strong> Sexual orientation and gender identity are integral aspects of ourselves. Guaranteeing that LGBT people are not condemned to forced concealment or retaliation when their identity is revealed should constitute an inalienable human right.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The second reason is economic</strong>. The exclusion of LGBT+ people impedes economic development through a wide range of channels, such as lower investment in human capital, reduced output, and productivity, public spending on social and health services that might be better spent elsewhere.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The third reason why LGBT+ inclusion should constitute a priority is social.</strong> LGBT+ inclusion is viewed as conducive to the emergence of less restrictive gender norms that improve gender equality broadly speaking and, hence, expand social and economic roles, especially for women.<strong>[xx] </strong>Consistent with this intuition, acceptance of homosexuality is strongly correlated with support for gender equality worldwide.</li><li><strong>Making LGBT+ individuals and the discrimination they face visible in national statistics&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>Awarding the world that LGBT+ individuals constitute a sizable minority that is discriminated against is an important prerequisite in order to improve their inclusion. Greater publicity of discriminatory behavior can indeed bring meaningful change, in particular through greater self-control of discriminating individuals.</p>



<p>Collecting information on sexual orientation and gender identity in censuses as well as national labor force, health, and victimization surveys are critical to creating awareness. However, only a minority of OECD countries (15) have included such questions in at least one of their nationally representative surveys, and even fewer (11 countries) do so on a regular basis. Yet, these countries constitute helpful precedents that contribute to disseminate good practices on how to best collect such sensitive information. The United Kingdom is, for instance, planning to include a question on sexual self-identification in its 2021 census.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enforcing Anti-Discrimination and Equality Laws</strong></li></ul>



<p>Legally prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination and ensuring equal rights to LGBT+ individuals is essential for their inclusion. One cannot expect to improve the situation of sexual and gender minorities if, to begin with, the law does not protect them against discrimination and abuses. As an illustration, LGBT+ employees report lower perceived discrimination and are more comfortable being open about their sexual orientation in firms that ban discrimination against them. LGBT+ employees also declare greater job commitment, improved workplace relationships, increased job satisfaction, and better health outcomes in these settings. Recently, the top court in the US has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country&#8217;s civil rights laws.<strong>[xxi]</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Educating People in Countering their Unconscious Biases</strong></li></ul>



<p>Unconscious bias training should constitute a key component of any policy package aiming to improve LGBT+ inclusion. This training consists of making individuals aware of their unconscious prejudices and stereotypes and teaching them how to overcome them. Increasing attention is being devoted to training recruiters, managers, and employees at large.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</h4>



<p>There is still a long way to go before lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender individuals meet full-fledged legal acceptance. LGBT+ people are still stigmatized and exposed to various forms of discrimination, despite the fact that some LGBT+ individuals managed to make it to the top. Discrimination is not only ethically unacceptable; it also entails substantial economic and social costs. Examining violence and discrimination against sexual and gender minority persons will help us understand better, the gendered dynamics behind exclusionary politics and violence. Laws prohibiting same-sex relations are found in the penal codes of many countries in the world. Although few cases are actually prosecuted under these laws, such criminalization contributes to the stigmatization of LGBT individuals in the media, public, and the workplace.</p>
