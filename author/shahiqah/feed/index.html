<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Water is an essential natural resource. It is a basic requirement for the survival of living organisms. Clean drinking water is important for a healthy life. Even though more than 70% of Earth is covered by water, less than three percent of the water covering the earth is freshwater, and the bulk of that is not even accessible as that is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Therefore, very less (approximately 1%) is available for our day to day consumption and fulfilling our various needs. Thus, while we may think that water will always be available in abundance, it is not so, instead, scarcity of <strong>fresh water is one of the</strong> <strong>major environmental problems of the 21st century.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Water Scarcity: A Global Crisis</strong></h4>



<p>Nothing is more essential than water on earth. Yet, according to an estimation of the World Health Organisation, it has been seen that almost 700 million people, i.e. 1 in 10 people, lack access to water, and almost 4 billion people experience water scarcity at least one month in a year. Though water scarcity is a global issue, it has been found that it affected developing and underdeveloped countries the most. In some countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, less than half the population has access to clean water. The condition is so grave that the ‘World Economic Forum’ has ranked the water crisis as the top biggest risk to humanity and human economics. Even the United Nations has said that two-thirds of the human population is going to face water scarcity by 2025.</p>



<p>Water scarcity can range from a challenging but manageable water shortage to a full-blown water crisis. Further, when it comes to the <strong>classification of water scarcity</strong>, for better understanding, it is classified into physical water scarcity and economic water scarcity.</p>



<p><strong>Physical water scarcity </strong>or <strong>Absolute water scarcity refers to </strong>a situation when there isn&#8217;t an adequate amount of water available to meet the demand, i.e. demand outpaces the limited water resources available in a given region.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Economic water scarcity refers to</strong> water scarcity which occurs primarily because of poor infrastructure or mismanagement of water resources. It may also arise due to unregulated use of water in agriculture or industry, at the expense of the general population.</p>

<h4><strong>What Causes Water Scarcity? </strong></h4>



<p>The rate at which we are moving towards a global water crisis which seems to be irrevocable is alarming. Though we rely on water for our survival, we as humans are the biggest contributors to the present crisis. Water systems are increasingly stressed, and some rivers, lakes, and other water bodies are drying up due to a variety of causes, many of which are a result of human activity. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the chief causes of water scarcity in the world are discussed below:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Pollution:</strong> UN World Water Assessment Program estimated in 2003 that every day, 2 million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged into the world’s water, the equivalent of the weight of the entire human population. The portable water which is already present at very low levels is further made unfit for consumption by pollution. Almost 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to drink water that is contaminated from feces as per the UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. Further, hundreds of millions of people worldwide are strained to consume water that is dangerously, chemically polluted as well. <strong>The chart below identifies some of the chief sources of water contamination.</strong></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZALKE_O29xkZHXqLbANPiC_VhRRPAww4dipbjAjenScRZrck9e_5ZMhIVIC74y92-tz2Qb6V1ZErOv-pnFaBMDh4zywX8JgDLN12dg8n4W3f-rOlExml8OeVq125Vzh5uiIOVtvz" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Causes of Water Pollution</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Climate Change: </strong>Over the last 25 years, floods, droughts, and other weather-related events have caused more than 90% of major weather-related disasters. Such events are further expected to increase in severity and frequency with climate change. InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that climate change over the 21st century may reduce the renewable water resources significantly in many dry sub-tropical regions. If the existing climate change pattern continues, UN WWDR 2009 (World Water Development Report) reveals, by 2030 water scarcity in some arid and semi-arid places will displace around 700 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Population Growth: </strong>It has been witnessed that population growth has doubled up in almost the last 50 yrs. Because of such fast growth, there has been an increase in demand for water consumption. This rapid growth with industrialization over years has adversely affected the water ecosystem. As the global water supply remains fixed and consumption increases it ultimately leads to water shortage.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qyKJRrl4m2LACM4RR3Su_IRaRt7uwe3hfivBzBrfGHhsGynZECrwiGLLoHkDg4uHaSMFHGUQ8en6WNiy6e3kBwfpWaohd_5NZMM7iz1BHPvh1zaNnhzLnCD9mAFel2YZuu4Qx6bi" alt=""/></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Wastage of Water: </strong>It has been on record that there is excessive use of water which leads to its wastage.<strong> </strong>In a mapped study done by NASA, it was revealed that 21 of the world’s major 37 water sources are distressed, mostly because of overuse from human consumption. The amount of wastewater produced annually is approximately 6 times more water than exists in all rivers of the world, i.e., about 1500 km³. People who have unlimited access to water use it indiscriminately without even thinking about those who are deprived of such a blessing.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Uneven Distribution of Water Resources:&nbsp;</strong>Due to the uneven distribution of potable water across the globe many areas face shortage of water. Most of North America, Europe, Brazil, and even parts of Africa, currently have more than enough renewable freshwater. Other regions are desperately under-served, like North Africa, Middle East, India, Mexico, large portions of South America and many Islands.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6eNMRTQXXUdzn-A_xHc5g0Vz6LWH8pPaC-XN6-OYUUN44KxLzqiU_9SyLPeJnHTOOUla2cdOCxxTcfcWR8N1EqgkHkBvUPnyOieijDkdUqPVFoSyTiyMYqPD-V4PM9g0XnJcHZ9X" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>What are the Consequences of Water Scarcity? </strong></h4>



<p>Indiscriminate use of water and reckless behavior of human beings has resulted in acute water scarcity which has caused calamitous effects. It has been estimated that by 2040, not much water would be available to meet the demand of humans as well as ecosystems.</p>



<p><strong>Some effects of water scarcity are listed below:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Food Shortage: </strong>Shortage of water has a grave impact on agricultural production. Agricultural production being a basic necessity that requires almost 70% of water, suffers gravely due to the shortage of water. With the increase in population and scarcity of water, it gets difficult to meet food demands, crop yield gets low. This can give rise to starvation and also leads to higher food costs.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GFVCEo1pSpZKbN453XPoN-3QuT34-XTQ-mfbhfseX5KvJsEmQDlgCbQDQyFnJ6eJIHvvD8efvCa25pL-7OKoNViD3VDIbGrJcpG-bD5aC_BMvdbtZ_-D8FgvVH7_mALKO7_Z_Ynn" alt="" width="657" height="475"/></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Health and Wellbeing:</strong> The scarcity of water affects healthy hygiene and proper sanitation which gives rise to numerous health-related and other problems. UNICEF in 2019 reported,&nbsp; 2 out of 5 people worldwide do not have a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home, and half of the global population lack safely managed sanitation services. Further,&nbsp; people living in areas with contaminated water are more likely to be infected by deadly water-borne diseases such as cholera, hepatitis, diarrhea, etc., with <strong>almost 1 million people dying every year from water</strong>, sanitation, and hygiene-related diseases. Also, every 2 minutes a child dies from a water-borne disease with diarrhea being one of the top causes, contributing an estimate of around 1.5 million deaths every year.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Threatened Ecosystem: </strong>Water scarcity has directly affected flora and fauna across the Globe, especially the disappearing of wetlands and damaging ecosystems. According to research by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), about half of the world’s wetlands have been destroyed since 1900. Due to scarcity of water, the ecosystem has imbalanced which resulted in the shrinking of sea bodies, in many areas seas have disappeared and left out is polluted land. &nbsp;Also, UNESCO reported in 2017 that 80% of wastewater flows back to the ecosystems without being treated or reused. Thus, the biological health keeps on deteriorating with the native plant and animal species becoming extinct.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Economic Slowdown:</strong> Shortage of water slows down economic activities. As suggested by a report of Water.Org, an estimated $260 billion is lost annually due to a lack of basic water and sanitation. Lack of freshwater, which is of primary use in agricultural and industrial activities, results in decreased outputs and increased prices, which in turn results in poverty and hence, a negative impact on the economy.</li><li><strong>Impact on Women and Children:</strong> Across the Globe women and children are worst hit by water scarcity. Mostly it has been seen that they bear the primary responsibility for collecting water and according to Water.Org, they spend a collective of 200 million hours a day collecting water. While women, like those in Sub-Saharan Africa, are responsible for collecting more than 70% of water, face negative impacts on their health, education, and safety, children also miss their schools because they have to spend hours collecting water. Likewise, poor sanitation keeps kids, especially girls, from being able to go to school. In many countries when girls reach the age of puberty and start menstruating they leave school, as there is a lack of water in restrooms and they have no other facilities to redress their needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increased Global Conflict:</strong> The increasing scarcity of water in the world has become a major cause of conflict. The World Economic Forum listed the water crisis at number four among the top ten risks faced by the world for 8 consecutive years. It can be weaponized and used to destroy or redirect access to water by countries to meet their objectives by targeting infrastructure and supplies. As per the Pacific Institute&#8217;s Water Conflict Chronology, out of 926 conflicts that have occurred in the past decade, 466 were related to water. The main water-related reasons that lead to conflict include; dependency on one major water source, disputes over dams, reservoirs, and other large scale projects. In fact, a new study by NASA interpreted that World War III is going to be fought over the scarcity of water if things don’t change soon.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Water Scarcity: Management</strong></h4>



<p>The urgent crisis that is unfolding before the world in the form of water scarcity requires an equally urgent response. Different international actors such as the UN and its agencies have been working tirelessly to ensure that the basic need of life, i.e., water is made available to all. Accordingly, the United Nations under its Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) calls for clean water and sanitation for all people.<strong> It aims to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” at least by 2030. </strong>Management of the crisis, however, becomes more important in areas that are most water-stressed, such as the <strong>Middle East</strong>, <strong>North Africa</strong>, and <strong>Asia</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>Middle East </strong>and<strong> North Africa </strong>(<strong>MENA</strong>) is the world&#8217;s most water-scarce region with total water productivity being only about half the world’s average. This region is the home to the top 10 worst-hit countries by water scarcity (Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iran, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E.).&nbsp; The situation there is worsening due to the impacts of conflict, climate change, and economic downturn. The World Bank has estimated that this region has the greatest expected economic losses from climate-related water scarcity, approximately up to 14% of GDP by 2050. The water crisis threatens the region’s stability as well as its human development and sustainable growth. Flood and drought risks are increasing and are likely to harm the poor disproportionately. However, the region is gearing up to deal with the challenge on several fronts. Some countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Palestine have approved national water resources plans. Other countries have developed frameworks that contain elements of policy, in the form of strategy or master plans. The region, being mostly dependent on transboundary water resources, is beginning to recognize the importance of an integrated approach to water management. <strong>The Gulf Cooperation Council countries ( Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., etc.) collect and treat almost 84% of the wastewater generated there</strong>. Some huge projects are also being developed to cope with water stress, for example,<strong> Qatar</strong> has started its “Water Security Mega Reservoirs Project” to store portable water as per the expected consumption rates in 2036; <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> launched the “Qatrah (water droplet in Arabic) Program” which sets to conserve water and reduce water usage by approximately 40-50% within the next decade.</p>



<h4><strong>What’s the situation in Asia?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Asia</strong> which is currently home to 4.5 billion people uses around 65% of the world’s water supply. Around 30% of the Asian population is already facing water scarcity. As a result of population growth, industrial development, and urbanization, the water crisis has become particularly acute. Many river basins already are unable to fulfill the demand for water that they face. According to the research of the International Institute for Applied System Analysis’ (IIASA) Water Program, by 2050, the water scarcity will further increase in almost 70 to 80% of the Asian regions. The problem in the region, however, has not been so much because of a shortage of water, as it has been because of poor management of the water resources and infrastructure. Nevertheless, in recent years, the countries have realized the gravity of the situation and have started taking some stern measures to deal with the crisis. Some of the worst affected countries in the regions, such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, China, Singapore, etc. have taken the lead in handling the situation through making new laws, designing new projects, and adopting new methods. <strong>Indian Government in 2019 set up a new ministry, the ‘Jal Shakti Ministry’, to prioritize the provision of clean drinking water for all</strong>, Pakistan drafted a National Water Policy and ‘Pakistan Water Charter’ to plan, develop, monitor, coordinate and manage its water resources. Countries such as China, Nepal, and <strong>Indonesia</strong> developed major projects to curtail the scarcity of water and to meet the increasing demands of their people, such as the ‘Mega Water Diversion Project’, the ‘Melamchi Drinking Water Project’ and the ‘National Urban Water Supply Project’ respectively.</p>



<p>Though the task at hand is very challenging, however, the current approach of the governments certainly has the capability of producing fruitful results for the people of this region in particular and of the world in general.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years there have been many academic studies, governmental policies, industrial plans, and much more to improve the management of water, reduction of inefficient use of water and to avoid a global crisis of water, yet, the world is still facing a problem of looming global water crisis. Although the situation concerning the availability of water is very bad and it may seem to be beyond any repair, it is important to know that the water crisis is solvable. Water is a renewable resource and therefore, lack of access to water isn’t a law of nature.<strong> Instead, it is just a matter of management, efficiency, regulations, infrastructure, funding, and most importantly, it’s a matter of sincerity in people’s efforts to preserve water resources and to prevent further depletion</strong>. In fact, studies also suggest that water scarcity can be reduced significantly by 2050 if the world commits to make some big, and practical changes. These changes, however, have to be multidisciplinary, which means that the water resources must be managed with a goal of ensuring equity in the economy and social welfare without compromising with the ecosystem.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Therefore, there have to be&nbsp; threefold solutions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Environmental policy:</strong> preservation and restoration of ecosystems as they naturally collect, store, filter and release water, such as wetlands and forests.</li><li><strong>Economic </strong>and <strong>Social solutions: </strong>improvement of environmental infrastructure and shifting to organic farming and other sustainable methods to reduce pollution.</li><li><strong>Engineering Technologies: </strong>designing technologies to benefit the environment and address water scarcity issues, such as improving irrigation technologies, rainwater harvesting, etc.</li></ul>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Human Rights are the basic universal and inalienable rights and fundamental freedom guaranteed to every individual against any inhumane and arbitrary treatment. These are the inherited rights granted equally to all human beings irrespective of ethnicity, nationality, race, color, sex, religion, or otherwise. The basis of Human rights is to treat everyone without any discrimination which includes civil, political, economical, social, and cultural rights in order to keep society equitable.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>These rights are not just abstract concepts but set out the necessary standards for people to live a dignified life. Human rights define the relationship between an individual and country and demands guaranteed protection from any unfair treatment and discrimination. Human Rights set out the choice for subjects to choose their govt. They are free to choose any form of Govt., whether democratic or non-democratic. In democracies, people can easily voice an opinion on their choice of the ruler while in non- democratic countries, it depends on the nature of the will of people to choose their ruler to whom they have submitted their wills.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Origin&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Human rights are thought to have developed differently in different cultures and philosophies. People around the world have different concepts of basic human rights based on their religion, political affiliations, or other factors. Human rights were first seen to originate from religious beliefs. It was believed to be God-given and human beings adopted those beliefs as opposed to natural rights. Later philosophers from early modern Europe like Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke developed new norms and traditions. Natural rights were not seen as merely moral claims but they were considered to reflect the most fundamental human drives leading to truly human existence. By the late eighteenth century, such ideas were used as a means of constraining the government&#8217;s sphere of autonomy as was expressed in the US Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and in the Citizen (1789). It acquired an international dimension when the Congress of Vienna attempted to abolish the slave trade which was eventually achieved by the Brussels Convention (1890) and formally outlawed by the Slavery Convention (1926). The horrendous memories of WWII, especially the “Final Solution” to Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs in the extermination camps of Nazi Germany, established a modern agenda for human rights at the international forums. The UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and human rights violations affected the domestic policies as well as informed the foreign policy decisions of states, which were until then given second class status at the expense of “national security”.</p>



<p>As far as non-democratic states are considered the chances of human rights violations are more given the lack of accountability of the governments towards their respective subjects. There is no system of check and balance, no free press, and no fair trial. This can make the conditions worse for the dissidents as citizens can be penalized on vague charges and face indefinite detention. In some of the non- democratic, authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Venezuela, Jordan, Cuba, Turkmenistan innumerable gross human rights violations have been reported and people are unable to get it redressed till now.</p>



<h4>Social Perception Around The Issue</h4>



<p>According to a Journal Published on “Citizens’ Perceptions of Human Rights Practices: An Analysis of 55 Countries” by Matthew Carlson and Ola Listhaug; The concept of Human Rights is said to be accepted differently in society and there is a limited agreement to what human rights actually means. They gave an example that most scholars accept the argument that Human rights are rights which include civil, political, economic, and social aspects as mentioned under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, they mention that recent global comparisons of human rights practices are likely to be concerned with narrow concepts that focus on ‘individual integrity’ i.e., the right to be free from torture, imprisonment, execution, or disappearance.</p>



<p>Further, it is agreed upon that Citizens of oppressive countries are likely to have more negative perceptions than citizens of countries with more appreciative human rights records and even believed that highly educated individuals are more analytical towards human rights violations in repressive societies than in less repressive societies. It is mentioned that the level of political terror within a country’s age, gender, opinion of an individual, will have a different approach of human rights conditions, depending on their life experiences, opportunities, and the amount of&nbsp;information available to them.</p>



<h4><strong>Non-Democratic Countries And Human Rights Violations Analysis:</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia has a Kingdom of monarchy ruled by King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is both head of state and head of Government. The Government has been responsible for various human rights issues like executions for non-violent offences, forced disappearance, and torture. The people are denied the right to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The Government has harassed, arbitrarily detained, and prosecuted dozens of government critics, activists, including women’s rights activists and members of the Shi’a community.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association and Belief</h4>



<p>Saudi authorities continue to repress free thinkers, human rights activists, and independent clerics. Activists have been sentenced to long term imprisonments for charges arising from their peaceful activism. Four prominent activists—Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sadah, and Nouf Abdulaziz—have been imprisoned and remained in detention without any trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Saudi authorities opened a separate trial of prominent human rights activists, Nassima al-Sadah and Samar Badawi before the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, where charges against them have not been made public. Saudi Arabia does not tolerate public worship by followers of religions other than Islam. Saudi Arabia has no written laws concerning gender identity, and judges use principles of Islamic law to sanction people committing sexual relations outside marriage, adultery, extra-marital affairs, and homosexuality.</p>



<h4>Criminal Justice System</h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia applies Sharia (Islamic law) as its national law. On April 23, 2019, a mass execution of 37 men was carried out in various parts of the country. At least 33 were from the country’s minority Shia community who had been convicted following unfair trials for various alleged crimes, including protest-related offenses, espionage, and terrorism. According to Interior Ministry statements, Saudi Arabia executed 179 persons between January and mid-November for murder and drug crimes. Eighty-one among those executed were convicted for non-violent drug crimes. Executions are carried out by firing squad or beheading, sometimes in public.</p>



<h4>Right Granted in its Entirety </h4>



<p>Women and girls continued to face systematic discrimination in law and in practice in other areas such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and the ability to pass on citizenship to their children.</p>



<p>Shi’a Muslims continued to face discrimination because of their faith, limiting their right to express religious beliefs and access justice, as well as their right to work in a number of public sector professions and access state services.</p>



<p>Some migrant workers suffer abuses and exploitation, sometimes amounting to conditions of forced labor. The kafala (visa sponsorship) system ties migrant workers’ residency permits to “sponsoring” employers, whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country under normal circumstances. Some employers confiscate passports, withhold wages, and force migrants to work against their will.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>hina</h4>

<p>In China, the human rights condition continues to worsen. The justice system remains in trouble because of unfair trials, torture, and ill-treatment during detention. LGBTI people face widespread discrimination and stigma in society. Due to inadequate medical services, they take serious risks by seeking unregulated and improper gender-affirming treatments. LGBTI people also face abuses in the form of “conversion therapy”.</p>



<p>The government continues to intimidate, harass, and prosecute human rights defenders and independent NGOs, by raiding their homes and offices. Even the family members of the activists are being harassed and detained. They are put under police surveillance and restrained from any movement.</p>



<h4><strong>J</strong>ustice System</h4>



<p>President Xi Jinping proposes to bring the legal system under the ambit of the Chinese Communist Party’s absolute leadership. Law enforcement and the judicial system remains largely under the control of the party. China has legalized arbitrary and secret detention, such as “residential surveillance in a designated location” and an extrajudicial system of detention (Liuzzi). These plans allow for solitary confinement which increases the risk of torture and other ill-treatment.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Religion and Belief</h4>



<p>The government has strengthened its restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. The authorities rigorously censor all media, from print media to online games.</p>



<p>Chinese authorities continue to tighten its grip on Christians and Muslims as China pushes ahead with the “sanitization of religion”, with a view to combating any religious activity. Many Buddhist and Taoist temples and statues, along with mosques and churches, are being damaged or destroyed at the direction of the government. There are various reports about the detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups continued in Xinjiang in “vocational training centers”, also known as “transformation-through-education” centers. An estimated up to one million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minority people were sent to concentration camps. Many religious figures, intellectuals, and academics have been detained in Xinjiang merely for exercising their rights to freedom of religion and expression.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>LGBTI people continue to face discrimination at home, at work, in schools, and in public. The authorities accept and claim to have implemented all recommendations on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression at the end of the country’s review process in the third cycle of the UN Universal Periodic Review in 2018. Two recommendations requested prohibition against discrimination in legislation, but there is no law that explicitly protects LGBTI people from discrimination.</p>



<p>The Human Rights defenders (HRDs) have been unable to commit to their work without any interference from the Government. The authorities systematically subject them to surveillance, harassment, intimidation, detention, and imprisonment. Many activists and HRDs continue to be prosecuted on vague and overly broad charges such as “subverting state power”, “inciting subversion of state power” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. Many are held in “residential surveillance in a designated location” on suspicion of involvement in state security crimes. This form of detention allows the police to detain individuals suspected of such crimes for up to six months in an unknown location outside the formal detention system, with suspects denied access to legal counsel and families.</p>



<h4><strong>Jordan</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A woman raises a Jordanian national flag as she stands amidst public school teachers demonstrating and demanding pay raises at the Professional Associations Complex in Jordan&#8217;s capital, Amman, on 3 October 2019. </strong></p>



<p>The authorities detain journalists and activists critical of the government or the King, demonstrators for demanding their and others’ release, as well as block websites of activists abroad.&nbsp; Jordan is a member of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the armed conflict in Yemen.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression and Assembly</h4>



<p>In February 2019,&nbsp; parliament’s lower house refused to enact a draft of cybercrime law presented by the government on the basis that the definitions were vague and that some provisions contradicted the penal code; the definition of hate speech was overly broad and risked severely curtailing freedom of expression. The authorities have blocked access to websites set up by Jordanian activists abroad seeking to record political developments and arrests of activists in Jordan. The authorities harass and detain activists and journalists who criticize the government or King Abdullah. Public protests organised without permission are stopped with arrest and detentions and demonstrators are made to sign a pledge that they would refrain from participating in the future.</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>Administrative detention against women is used usually for months and for discriminatory reasons, such as for being “absent from home” without a male guardian’s permission, or for having sex outside marriage (Zina), begging, or homeless. Women who become pregnant outside marriage face authoritarian detention and forcible abortion.</p>



<p>Citizenship laws of Jordan are biased against children of Jordanian mothers and non-Jordanian fathers, who, contrary to children of Jordanian fathers marry non-Jordanians, are denied Jordanian citizenship.</p>



<p>The Family Protection Department and the Ministry of Social Development continue to forcibly abort the babies from unmarried women, without consideration of the best interests of the child and mother.</p>



<p>Migrant domestic workers have been facing abuse by their employers and agents, and remain at risk of arbitrary detention by the state. They are detained after fleeing their employer&#8217;s residence without permission. Those under-privileged who seek work in order to earn money need attention from the state for their upliftment.</p>



<h4><strong>North Korea</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A commuter reads a newspaper while waiting for a train at a newsstand in a subway station in Pyongyang on June 19, 2019, ahead of a visit to the North Korean capital by Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 20. Xi will be the first Chinese leader to visit Pyongyang in 14 years. </strong></p>



<p>North Korea is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world with Kim Jong Un serving as head of government and ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, uses threats of execution, arbitrary punishment of crimes, detention, and forced labor to maintain fearful obedience. It continues restrictions on travel outside the country and incommunicado with the outside world.</p>



<p>The government doesn’t tolerate dissent. It has banned independent media, civil society, and trade unions, The Regime also schematically denies basic rights, including freedom of expression, association, and religion. It systematically extracts forced, unpaid labor from its citizens to build infrastructure and implement public projects. The government also fails to protect or promote the rights of numerous at-risk groups, including women, children, and people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2014 United Nations Commission of Inquiry (COI) report on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea)&nbsp; briefed that the government has committed crimes against humanity, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, and forced abortion. It recommended the UN Security Council refer the situation to the International Criminal Court.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>In 2019, Kim Jong Un’s government barred people from leaving North Korea without a permit, by blocking Chinese mobile phone services at the border, aiming to arrest those communicating with people outside the country or trying to leave, and broadcasting punishments imposed on persons caught escaping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The North Korean government systematically requires forced, uncompensated labor from most of its population—including workers at state-owned enterprises or deployed overseas, women, children, and prisoners—to control its people and sustain its economy. A majority of North Koreans are supposed to perform unpaid labor, often called “portrayals of loyalty” at some time in their lives. North Korea is one of the only seven UN member states that has not joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) and during the Universal Periodic Review, the government did not accept recommendations. This also goes against equality and ethical standards of treatment of labours.</p>



<h4><strong>Vietnam</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Environmental activist Nguyen Ngoc Anh (c) stands in a courtroom in June 2019 during his trial in Vietnam’s Ben Tre province, in which he was sentenced to six years in prison for “undermining” the government via his Facebook posts.</strong></p>



<p>In Vietnam, the Government has been committing various inhumane acts against human rights activists and has actively breached a number of human rights resolutions.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly</h4>



<p>Government has arbitrarily put restrictions on uploading content on Google, Youtube, and other online platforms. Media-censorship, limiting content, ads, and any news which is politically sensitive is termed as fake news. A court in Dong Nai sentenced two Facebook users, Vu Thi Dung and Nguyen Thi Ngoc Suong, to six years and five years’ imprisonment respectively, for reading and listening to materials on Facebook and distributing leaflets calling on people to protest against China and state oppression. They were charged with possessing materials “that aim to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam”.</p>



<p>Vietnam has banned the formation of independent labor unions, human rights organizations, and political parties. Those who dare to establish workers&#8217; unions face harassment, intimidation, and retribution. Labor activist Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung was imprisoned for helping to organize a strike in Tra Vinh province in 2010. Police immediately placed him under intrusive surveillance. Even after ratifying International Labor Convention 98 on collective bargaining and the right to organize unrecognized religious groups, Christian, and Buddhist groups face constant harassment and intimidation from the government. Followers of independent religious groups are subjected to public criticism, forced renunciation of faith, detention, interrogation, torture, and imprisonment.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Despite ratifying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various other human rights treaties, these states have been found grossly violating them and committing human rights violations on its citizens. Right to life, liberty, freedom of expression, right to dissent, protest, freedom of the press is being violated day in and day out. In order to bring justice and promote human rights, international communities and organisations need to put pressure on these states to amend laws, investigate crimes, and bring perpetrators to justice in courts.</p>



<p>There is an immense need for positive change vis a vis human rights, especially in authoritarian non-democratic states because the human rights situation continues to remain grim. Especially we can say this in the post- COVID 19 world because the governments all over the world are stepping into the sphere of individual rights and the states, in the facade of controlling the disease, are actively using intrusive surveillance techniques. There is also a role to play for human rights organisations to make the general population in non-democratic countries aware of the importance of human rights and put pressure on their respective governments so that every individual irrespective of his race, gender, religion, or ethnicity gets to live a life that is free from fear, intimidation or harassment.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>South Korea is situated in East <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Asia" class="rank-math-link">Asia</a> and is the neighbouring country of Japan. It is on 45% of the southern portion of the Korean peninsula,&nbsp; bordered by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). The capital of South Korea is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Seoul" class="rank-math-link">Seoul (Sŏul). South Korea has an ancient history and has come a long way since the Korean War, which ended in 1953. Despite the miserable conditions brought by War South Korea has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest economies in the 1990s. South Korea even joined the OECD(Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). No doubt, the country has </a>suffered grave economic poverty but it has emerged as a fully functioning modern democracy and one of Asia’s most prosperous countries by today.</p>



<h4><strong>History of South Korea</strong></h4>



<p>Around 668 A.D. various competing Kingdoms were unified into a single regime on the Korean Peninsula. These succeeding dominions maintained Korean political and cultural independence for almost a thousand years. The last of the ruling powers were the Choson Dynasty until the nineteenth century. Korea has survived many invasions by Japan and the Manchus of East Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the end of the 19th century, Korea made small success in relation to trade and diplomatic relations with western powers. By the beginning of the 20th century Japan, Russia, and China competed to take over the Korean Peninsula. Japan succeeded and annexed it over 5 years later after the Russo- Japanese War. This colonial rule was up to 35 years and after the Japanese were defeated in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union divided this peninsula into two zones. After two years, the pro-U.S. The Republic of Korea (or South Korea) was established with its capital Seoul. In the north, the Soviets put Kim II Sung as the first chief of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), better known as North Korea. South Korea’s announcement of independence in 1950 led North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, to occupy its neighbor in an attempt to recover control of the entire peninsula. U.S. and United Nations troops fought beside South Korean forces in the <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.history.com/topics/korean-war">Korean War</a>, which cost some 2 million lives before it ended in 1953.</p>



<h4><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Social Progress</strong></h4>



<p>According to EAI Issue Briefing on “South Korea’s Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Better Life For Girls Initiative” by Eun Mee Kim, the South Korean administration has promised to make up to Sustainable development goals. In its development, cooperative policies, and implementation plans, it has mentioned that it will implement SDGs to the fullest. Even Before the beginning of the SDG era South Korea announced various initiatives they would implement while aiming for achieving SDGs. Many of these initiatives have come up because of South Korea’s own experience. Various initiatives like the New Village Movement, support for education and global citizenship education and global health security, poverty reduction, social-economic development. “Better Life For Girls”&nbsp; is considered an important factor to promote healthcare and education for girls.</p>



<p>East&nbsp; Asia is the leading subregion on the eradication of poverty and hunger in accordance with SDGs 1 and 2 of the United Nations. However, in respect of SDGs 11, 13, and 15 i.e., sustainable cities and communities, climate action, and life on land respectively, East Asia has declined in East Asia since 2000. All measured targets in Goals 4,5,7,11,12,13, and 14 which are quality education, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water respectively, can only be achieved through rigorous efforts with the situation needing a dramatic turnaround. At the Indicator level, the top five target that is in need of correction are protection of forests and ocean health, formal and informal education and training, the concentration of air pollutants, and the number of refugees.</p>

<h4><strong>Comparative Study of Exponential Growth</strong></h4>



<p>Measures are taken and the Government’s role; According to the Economic History Association, The Economic History of Korea is divided into three periods;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The period of Malthusian stagnation up to 1910, when Japan annexed Korea;</li><li>The colonial period from 1910-45, when the country embarked upon modern economic growth; and&nbsp;</li><li>The post-colonial decades, when living standards improved rapidly in South Korea.</li></ol>



<p>South Korean policymakers revived economic growth by encouraging native industrial films following other developing countries. The government targeted certain firms and gave them the privilege to buy foreign currencies and to borrow funds from banks at favorable rates. It also eradicated the tax barriers and imposed a ban on manufacturing imports with the hope that it would provide protection to the domestic firms and give them a chance to improvise their productivity through training and importing advanced technologies. In the 1990s&nbsp; relaxing Capital accounts followed which caused rapid accumulation of short-term external debts. This, together with a highly leveraged corporate sector and the banking sector destabilized by the financial repression, provided the background to the contagion of the financial crisis from Southeast Asia in 1997.</p>



<p>South Korean economy grew at an average annual rate of nearly 9% during the last three decades and per capita income increased more than a hundredfold. South Korea got transformed into an industrial power because of highly skilled labor. Economic Growth was seen to be slowed in the late 20th century. In 1997 South Korea was forced to accept a $57 billion bailout from the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Monetary-Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), which is considered to be the largest rescue in the history of IMF. The country also changed the system of large families who owned business to liberalizing its economy. However, the country recovered its economic growth in the following years and the country gained its economic growth comparatively as it entered the 21st century.</p>



<p>With the growth of educational institutions, commercial and industrial enterprises, many people fled towards urban areas from rural areas. In particular, Seoul grew almost 10 fold to about 1o million people at the beginning of the 21st century. The same sort of growth was seen in the media sector, especially newspaper and magazine publishing. A purposive program was also initiated for the country&#8217;s transportation system to expand and modernize it.</p>



<p>The apparent social change in South Korea was the emergence of the middle class. Even a new elite class emerged from the habitual landholding class after the Land reform measures taken in the early 1950s and with the spread of modern education, which eventually vanished the once privileged Yangban (landholding) Class. As people migrated to urban areas there was a decline of the extended- family system as they started living in apartments as nuclear families and with family planning such significant social change took place.</p>



<p>In regard to Women Empowerment, there were campaigns held by women for complete legal equality and even were succeeded to get enhanced property ownership rights, the right to register as ahead of the family in a new family register system (hojŏk) that took effect in 2008. Under the older system, only men and their children were legally part of the father&#8217;s family register but not the mother. The introduction of the new system increased women’s legal standing in other matters as well be it divorce or child custody cases or in matters of inheritance (adopted and stepchildren rights to be equal to those of biological children).&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the early 21st century, South Korea achieved the aim of decreasing birth rates and less aging population by rapid urbanization, nuclear family system, and women’s active participation in the economy and lengthening life expectancies. The overall population is expected to decrease in the next decades as the government was concerned that fewer children and an aging society would slow economic growth and destabilize the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-security-government-program">social security</a> system in the future.</p>

<h4><strong>South Korea&#8217;s Developmental Model as an Inspiration for other Countries</strong></h4>



<p>South Korea is known for its fast economic development. It is perceived that one should learn from the developmental strategies of Korea. South Korea&#8217;s economic strategy began with an agricultural-based economy in the 1960s and became the 12th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP(Gross Domestic Product) by 2020. South Korea&#8217;s economic success is attributed to policy reforms involving opening the country to foreign markets. Export-orientated policies were an important factor in economic growth. South Korea is among the top 10 exporters in the world and its export percentage was reported at 44.01 % in 2018. An improvement in the business environment and Policies incentivizing investment in innovation were factors that have contributed to the increase in international trade and industrialization in South Korea. Such factors played an important role in uplifting investment, production, communication, and, eventually, economic growth, innovation, and technology being South Korean major factors establishing export competitiveness and led to the country&#8217;s significant economic rise over the past decades. The Human Resource Development, The adaptation of An Outward-Looking Strategy (Labor Intensive Manufacturing), and Raising funds to foster needed industrial development led to the Economic Booming in South Korea.</p>



<p>Other countries cannot achieve fast growth by just following Korean strategies as the economic, social, and political environment of each developing country are different. And there are strategies adopted by Korea which were important factors of growth but later on created problems. As every country has its own unique environment, it is not possible for them to adopt such strategies precisely but can follow some part of it after well consideration keeping in view their resources and infrastructures.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>South Korea is one of the fastest-growing economies in the World. Despite the Korean war which rendered the country poor in a miserable condition, thus the country was not only fighting for economic problems but for survival. South Korea managed to be the 12th largest economy in the World. Major factors in the Country’s economic development involve high levels of domestic savings, private domestic investments, and rapidly growing human capital. The Economic Booming of South Korea drives the attention of developing countries to follow their strategy. Considering South Korea’s relatively limited geographical size, natural resources, and population size, an aging population increases the threat that South Korea’s economy might have a downfall. South Korea needs to continue its support in innovation and a favorable business environment for the maintenance of sustainable economic growth.</p>
