<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>



<p>Oceans make the most of the earth’s hydrosphere and 72 percent of the earth’s surface. It is a precious asset; a great source of biodiversity, a great contributor to social well-being, economic prosperity, and quality of life. </p>



<p>To govern the oceans and to ensure that maritime activities do not contaminate this resource, the United Nations through its several programs is trying to protect these. Also, the international law of the sea includes all kinds of legal frameworks regarding the sea and its applicability to inter-state relations.</p>



<h3>FREEDOM OF THE SEA</h3>



<p>Even before any law regarding seas came into being, Spanish and Portuguese claimed universal maritime dominion. However, the freedom of the sea doctrine came as a challenge to it. Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist, and philosopher was the propounder of the principle of the freedom of the seas (mare liberum). He defined the seas as being, like the air, limitless and therefore common to all. So, seas were declared to be free and belonging to none. This doctrine was strongly pressed by the great maritime and commercial powers. Besides, it remains one of the most fundamental concepts of the law of the sea and is now recognized to include freedom of fishing, laying of submarine cables and pipelines, navigation, and overflight of aircraft.</p>



<p>However, this notion limited the national rights and jurisdiction over the oceans surrounding a nation&#8217;s coastline. Subsequently, by the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, serious conflicts arose as coastal states started to demand custom zones for exclusive fishing rights and for the conservation of maritime resources found in their continental shelves.</p>



<h4>UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON LAW OF SEA</h4>



<p>The United Nations International Law Commission, upon the request of the International Community, began codifying the laws related to oceans in 1949 and prepared four draft conventions which were adopted by the United Nations at its first conference on the law of the sea.</p>



<h4>THE FIRST UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA ( UNCLOS I )</h4>



<p>The United Nations in 1958 convened its first conference on the law of the sea which was attended by eighty-two states. UNCLOS 1 adopted four conventions :</p>



<ol><li>The Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone,</li><li>The Convention on the High Seas,</li><li>The Convention on&nbsp; Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, and</li><li>The Convention on the Continental Shelf.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Although it was a positive step towards the development of the law of the sea still, there were many loopholes in the convention like the breadth of the territorial sea belonging to the states was not decided under it.</p>



<h4><strong>THE SECOND UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (UNCLOS II)</strong></h4>



<p>This conference which was held in 1960 did not result in any international agreements as it once again failed to fix a uniform breadth of the territorial sea or arrive at a consensus on sovereign fishing rights.</p>



<h4><strong>THE THIRD UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (UNCLOS III)</strong></h4>



<p>Finally, in the 11<sup>th</sup> session, a conference was held in 1982 to deal with different drawbacks of the previous conventions. It has resolved many important issues pertaining to ocean usage and sovereignty such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided definition and breadth of different maritime zones;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong>Territorial Sea:</strong></li></ol>



<p>It is a portion of the sea which is adjacent to the coast and over which the coastal states can exercise sovereignty subject to the right of foreign ships to innocent passage. Under UNCLOS III the territorial water limit was agreed to be 12 nautical miles measured from the baseline.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Exclusive Economic Zone:</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>It is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea extending up to 200 nautical miles seaward from the baseline. In this zone, the coastal states have exclusive rights and duties, to, amongst other things, explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living, nonliving, and natural resources within this area.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Continental Shelf:</strong></li></ol>



<p>It is that area of the coastal state which comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea up to a distance of 200-350 nautical miles from the baseline. However, it shall not exceed beyond that.</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided certain rights to Coastal states as well as other states:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong>Rights of Coastal States:</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>They have certain exclusive rights including the right of fishing, rights over sea bed resources, rights to enact laws and regulations relating to transport and navigation, and the right to hold states responsible for non-compliance, etc.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Right of other states:</strong></li></ol>



<p>The convention secures the “right of innocent passage” to other states through the territorial water of coastal states. Such a right implies that as long as a vessel has a purpose of traveling across the territorial sea, it amounts to innocent passage, which cannot be hindered by the coastal state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided for the establishment of International Seabed Authority;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>It has also established an inter-governmental body known as the International Seabed Authority to organize, regulate, and control activities that are mineral-related in the international sea-bed area beyond the limits of the continental shelf of coastal states.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided conflict resolution methods;</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>For three decades, dispute settlement under this convention has flourished, in the form of negotiation, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, and formation of the commission on the continental shelf.</p>



<h4><strong>Protection of Marine Environment and Biodiversity</strong></h4>



<p>Oceans, despite being essential for survival, are subjected to a lot of degradation due to destructive human activities such as resource extraction, overfishing, pollution, etc. The United Nations under its various programs is working towards the protection of Marine Environment and Biodiversity:</p>



<p><strong>The United Nation Environmental Programme (UNEP)</strong> is trying to work out solutions and strategies which will diminish human impacts and promote good use of marine and coastal ecosystems:</p>



<ol><li>It is working to promote and restore coastal blue carbon ecosystems by advancing science-based management approaches, international cooperation, a regional and global assessment by using practical methods to conserve and restore this ecosystem.&nbsp;</li><li>It is also assisting nations to adopt equitable and effective uses of the marine environment while protecting areas by furnishing technical support and building a capacity for the management of these areas.&nbsp;</li><li>World’s coral reefs, which generate millions of dollars annually, are degrading at a high rate due to destructive fishing, unsustainable development, ocean acidification, etc. UNEP is trying to protect these reefs by working with different stakeholders and partners such as <strong>International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), Regional Seas Programme, Reef world, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Since the coming of the Regional Seas Programme, the United Nations has significantly been able to address the generation of the world&#8217;s oceans through a “shared seas” approach, which is to engage adjacent nations in extensive and particular actions to conserve their common marine environment.</li><li>UNEP is also hosting the <strong>Global Programme of Action (GPA)&nbsp;</strong> for the protection of the marine environment from land-based activities to deal with land-based pollution which contributes to nearly 80% of marine pollution. It emphasizes addressing three primary source categories that are, marine litter, nutrient management, and wastewater. <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/oceans-seas/what-we-do/addressing-land-based-pollution"></a>source: www.unenvironment.org</li></ol>



<h4><strong>International maritime organization (IMO)</strong></h4>



<p>It was established as a specialized agency for the advancement of international maritime law. Its main purpose is to create and maintain a broad regulatory framework for shipping and safety, legal matters, environmental concerns, technical co-operations, and efficiency of shipping.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Marine shipping and pollution:</strong> In order to reduce air pollution due to shipping, IMO has adopted different measures. These include;</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973</strong>, now known as MARPOL. It addresses pollution from ships caused due to noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, garbage, and oil. MARPOL has significantly been able to reduce pollution from international shipping. These measures have ensured that oil tankers are made and operated safely and in such a way so as to ensure very little oil is spilled in accidents.</li><li>With regard to chemicals, it has been instructed that the design of ships should be such as to reduce the risks to ships, their crew, and the environment. Moreover, it has been prohibited to discharge sewage into the sea.</li><li>It limits the use of main air pollutants contained in ships such as sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide. The emission of ozone-depleting substances has also been prohibited.</li><li>Additionally, a separate convention has been made known as the International Convention For The Prevention Of Pollution Of The Sea By Oil (oil pool).</li></ul>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Polar Code:</strong> It is foreseen that the polar maritime traffic is going to increase in the coming years. These regions are visited because of commercial imperatives and growing tourism, in the north and south respectively. However, this should not hamper the life of the sea and the sustainability of the environment of Polar Regions. Moreover, the protection of the environment and security of ships navigating in tough, remote, and exposed Polar Regions has always been a concern for IMO. There are different challenges to the ships operating, that are a shortage of communication systems, good charts, different navigational aids, and poor weather conditions.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ul><li>With the growing polar shipping, IMO has addressed International concern about the protection of the polar environment and the safety of seafarers and passengers by introducing new regulations that all ships operating in these waters must comply with.&nbsp;</li><li>International Code For Ships Operating In Polar Waters (polar code) is mandatory under both the International Convention For The Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLACE) and MARPOL. It sets out mandatory standards that cover the wide range of design and construction, equipment, operational and training concern, rescue, and the protection of the pristine environment and ecosystems of both the poles as well.&nbsp;</li><li>Each chapter contains different aims and functions that include watertight and weathertight integrity, ship structure, machinery installations, the safety of navigation, voyage planning, training, etc. on one hand and prevention of pollution due to oil, chemicals, sewage, and the discharge of garbage on the other and.</li></ul>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Piracy: </strong>An unauthorized act of violence committed by a private vessel in seas against another vessel with intent to loot or rob is called piracy. It is considered to be an international crime and pirates as enemies of every state. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/hqqKCm4TxULeffCw6"></a></li></ol>



<ul><li>At the beginning of the present century, the acts of piracy have increased particularly on the coasts of Somalia. At least, Eighty-four attacks and millions of dollars have been robbed, many have been killed, injured and hundreds of hostages were taken in a single year. To tackle this problem, representatives of Somalia urged the president of the Security Council for the safety of the shipping and navigation. Consequently, a resolution was adopted to condemn all acts of piracy in territorial waters and high seas in Somalia.&nbsp;</li><li>Also, IMO has developed certain regulations and guidance through the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) to secure and manage travel and trade across seas. Thus, it has addressed the issue of piracy and armed robbery against ships too.&nbsp;</li><li>Due to the above-mentioned situation in Somalia, IMO is trying to enhance maritime security in west and central Africa, with the region&#8217;s maritime agreements. Fortunately, ill effects of piracy have been mitigated over time because of the adoption of several anticipatory measures by IMO with the support of shipping industries. Its armed robbery and piracy module has information publicly available with the globally integrated shipping information system.</li><li>Further,&nbsp; the member states who seek to enlarge their national measures for the threat of piracy and different unlawful activities can get IMO’S assistance.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission</strong></h4>



<p>The United Nations educational, scientific, and cultural organizations&#8217; Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)&#8217; works to promote international cooperation and coordinates programs pertaining to marine research, services, hazard mitigation, observation systems, and effective management of the resources of coastal areas and oceans. This commission aims to foster management, administration, decision-making processes for sustainable development of the marine environment.</p>



<h4><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h4>



<p>The United Nations through the conventions and formation of IMO covers various aspects of the sea such as navigation, fishing, deep seabed mining, etc. It is accepted today worldwide that the convention of 1982 is a &#8216;constitution for the oceans&#8217;, within which every activity pertaining to seas must be done. As far as resource extraction and utilization of these oceans in its different aspects are concerned, the same should be carried out in a way so as to not abate the marine environment and biodiversity.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>There has always been a diplomatic correlation across the Korean Peninsula. Which is situated in East Asia, extending southwards up to 684 miles from continental Asia into the Pacific Ocean. The inter-Korean relations have experienced a lot of ups and downs, from hostile confrontations and terrorist attacks to summit meetings, since the division and subsequent Korean War. The conflicts between North and South Korea have immensely affected the civilians in terms of loss of their lives, torn family ties, huge infrastructure destructions, and much more.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there have been attempts by both sides as well as the United Nations with the help of different states to sort out their issues. Yet, no significant event of reconciliation can be marked.<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/tcduxXgq3Hvn9FRE9"></a></p>



<h4><strong>Historical Perspective of the dispute:</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Pre War Scenario</strong></li></ul>



<p>Korea was once part of the Mongolian Empire and it was ruled by China. In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, Korea became an independent empire for a while before being conquered by Japan. Throughout the Japanese rule, Koreans faced a lot of problems to preserve their culture. However, it continued to hold together and gained its independence piece by piece.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Division of the Peninsula</strong></li></ul>



<p>After Japan surrendered at the end of World War II, Korea became independent, but the United States and Soviet Union agreed in 1945 to divide the country for administrative purposes at the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel, in order to disarm the Japanese army from Korea. Meanwhile, a decision could not be agreed upon that would unify Korea. Further, the US government became anxious at the possibility of Korea falling under Soviet dominance. Therefore, the government of the US requested Soviet forces to stop its advancement at the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel north and to abandon the south of the peninsula, including the capital city Seoul, so that it can be inhabited by the US.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Arrival of Soviet Union and United states.</strong></li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same year, the Soviet army made its way into Pyongyang (the present-day capital of North Korea) and set up a military government over it and on the other side, US forces arrived in the south and established the United States Army Military Government in Southern Korea.</p>



<p>Later, the war-time synergy between the Soviet Union and the US worsened as the cold war took place. The Soviet Union supported Korean communists in North Korea and Kim Il-Sung, who had assisted in the Soviet Army, became the major political figure while as in the South, anti-communist Syngman Rhee appeared as the most eminent politician.</p>



<p>Besides, the US government took the matter to the United Nations, resulting in the formation of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK). However, the Soviet Union was against this move. Consequently, the general elections were held by UNTCOK in the south, due to which the Republic of Korea got established with Syngman Rhee as its President, replacing the US military occupation on 15 August 1947. In North Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was established with Kim Il-sung, as its Prime Minister.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Korean War (1950-1953)</strong></li></ul>



<p>The real war began when North Korea invaded the South. It was backed by the Chinese government and the Soviet Union, crossed the 38th parallel, and attacked South Korean forces. The United Nations Security Council in response to this act of North aided South Korea and sent forces immediately. Out of twenty-one countries who militarily aided, primary support came from the US. The support of the US was more for the quelling of the concept of communism rather than putting an end to the Korean border dispute. Moreover, it believed if they let Korea down, the Soviets will swallow up places one after another.</p>



<p>The North Korean army was much more trained and equipped and had high morale as compared to the South Korean army and allies, they could not stand the fight and were dying because of thirst and dangerous diseases. It was evident from their condition that they were on the verge of defeat. Here, the US desperately needed to relieve pressure on its forces, so it was decided that an amphibious invasion behind North Korean forces would be launched. The plan was risky, but it was successful, the North Korean forces were cut off from their supply lines and forced to fight on two fronts at the same time. This attack was a complete surprise to the north and the landing forces met with relatively little resistance. They were forced to go back to Pyongyang. This was a victory for the South and consequently, peace talks were held at a border village known as Panmunjom. For the first time in history, in the subsequent years jet fighters engaged in air to air fights, negotiations were impeded, combat continued and neither party could come to an agreement.&nbsp; <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/owvB7Py2koPwKw7N7"></a></p>



<ul><li><strong>Signing of Armistice.</strong></li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, both the Koreas signed an armistice (an agreement between two countries who are at war that they will stop fighting). However, Syngman Rhee was against this, who tried to sabotage the arrangements for freedom of prisoners and conducted protest rallies against the armistice. Even when he refused to sign the agreement, unwillingly he had to abide by it. This armistice led to an official ceasefire, but not to an official peace treaty. A new boundary was drawn and a two-mile-wide demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two states was created. Despite its name, this border continues to be heavily militarized.<img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AF3EoOQ-7ayOT2yiSgAR6nuemiqqDHbdtyhFCoZSVmWoaDeJuP_CucGYSEXwEcV8XVk1VBEmmExDBRzdR8ZrW5P836r4aMoU6ln97Tc87ugJgntm_JKorG3BpxG5K98Zfemm3g" width="479" height="291"></p>



<p>It is reported that even after this armistice was signed, North Korea has announced at least six times that it would no longer abide by it.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of the War</strong></h4>



<p>This war proved to be disastrous for all of the Korea in the following ways:</p>



<ol><li>The first effect of the war was the loss of lives. In the three years of War, around 5 million people died. More than half of these were civilians. Also, 40,000 Americans were killed and lacs were injured. Though the War was relatively short, the rate of civilian casualties was more than that of World War II and the Vietnam War.  <img loading="lazy" width="602" height="353" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oo4wyBnzpJfgPKAraXd2GG17XX4a3nAAchGsZDEbx6c-c8u6NHRMVx3kaoaFZ7S_uqbyizMtE73Y9I27_TsbKGoZ0b93hEph5nwsqTNu1060WRNk6gliOk_t1FW-qAKmlORKlA"></li><li>Countless families were separated for decades; they had to live on two opposite sides of the demilitarized zone. They were not allowed to meet each other or even communicate. Although Red Cross has so far reunified over 20,000 family members, reunions were no longer allowed as tensions rose on the peninsula.<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/DfRM5vU1MkVicMx57"></a></li><li>The War proved to be devastating majorly for the industrial development of Korea, as half of the industries were damaged in the War and skilled laborers, employees also lost their lives. It damaged industrial infrastructure altogether with leaving thousands of people unemployed, struggling to fulfill their basic needs. </li><li>As US soldiers still remained in South Korea, it irritated the Chinese government and put a great impact on the relations between the two countries (US and China).</li><li>After the Soviet Union and China withdrew its support from North Korea it fell into poverty, having the highest military expenditure in the world. It remained a developing country with a great deal of famine, where people are reportedly oppressed and tortured. The press is also controlled by the state. Therefore, North Korea became isolated from the world. While on the other hand South Korea, earlier being under-developed and heavily dependent on foreign aid, transformed into a developmental powerhouse. Its economy grew at an average annual rate of 9% and per capita income increased more than a hundredfold. </li><li>Another long term effect was that War led to huge American rearmament. Their defense budget shot up to billions of dollars.</li><li>After all these years, the effects of the War still persist, there have been hundreds of cross-border incidents reported such as bombings, hijackings, espionages, kidnappings, assassinations, and shellings. 1968 being the deadliest year where 148 people were killed in cross-border incidents.</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>Post War Scenario.</strong></li></ul>



<p>The aftermath of the Korean War built tension between all the superpowers. It was important for the cold war, as it showed that two superpowers would fight a “proxy war” in another country. Being the first of its kind wherein, the United Nations participated. After the war, US forces stayed in the South but Chinese forces left and the conflict continued. On one hand, defense treaties were signed between the US and South Korea and on the other hand between North Korea, USSR, and china. Moreover, South Korea became an anti-communist military dictatorship till its first election while North Korea an orthodox communist dictatorship.</p>



<p>The dispute between the two elevated with the back-to-back armed clashes known as the Korean DMZ conflict. Since then, both sides kept on attempting to harm each other in one way or another. Later, the US removed its troops from the South and by the end of the cold war, the north also lost its support of the Soviet Union. By then, North Korea had started to develop nuclear weapons and missiles.</p>



<h4><strong>Reconciliation Efforts</strong></h4>



<p>The first-ever contact was carried out by the South Korean government in the form of a secret negotiation with the North for national reunification. However, the dialogue was short-lived. Then, by the end of the previous century, there was a sign of the restoration of harmony between the two states. But, North Korea’s nuclear weapon abilities became a source of tension for the South. Also, the then South Korean President initiated a policy (known as sunshine policy) in order to restore good relations with the North. A joint North-South industrial complex was built for the facilitation of trade at Kaesong (a city in North Korea). Things appeared to get better when North and South Korean athletes marched under a single flag at the summer Olympics to present the Korean peninsula. However, the policy was later abandoned because of the provocations by the North through active nuclear weapon testing. Consequently, the UN also issued a travel ban on the North and blocked their accounts. As a response to this, North Korea among other things revoked the 1953 sealed ceasefire agreement with the South.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the South Korean president’s hard approach towards Pyongyang, North Korea nullified all the military and political agreements with the South. In addition to this, it canceled all the business contracts relating to the Kaesong industrial complex. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/1q422f5rxNDLYqt27"></a></p>



<ul><li><strong>Summit Meeting.</strong></li></ul>



<p>In 2018, the two presidents (Kim jong-un and Moon-Jae-in) met in a summit wherein the former agreed to denuclearize North Korea if the United States also agreed to peace treaties. Accordingly, in order to prevent clashes, end hostility on land, sea, and air the governments established buffer zones across DMZ. However, recently North Korea destroyed an inter-Korean joint liaison office with missiles, calling South Korea an enemy and not a partner for pacification.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>It is difficult to alter the essence of inter-Korean relations but almost impossible to unify them. In fact, the series of terms of exchange and cooperation between them failed to harmonize their relationship. The main cause can be the difference of unchanging perspectives of both sides pertaining to the unification of the Korean Peninsula.</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, unification is not the most important matter here, as is the threat to the peace of civilians of South as well as North. Rightly stated in a Korean proverb, that when two whales fight, it is the small fish that are devoured in the process. The war, though called “ limited”, led to large painful casualties of Americans, Chinese, troops of various countries, and most of all to the people of Korea.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Terrorism has been a major issue in the Philippines for decades altogether, ranking ninth among the countries most affected by terrorism. Both communist, nationalist rebels and Islamic separatist insurgencies have put havoc on the nation. As a result of which, thousands of Filipinos have been killed in bombings, assassinations, kidnapping attempts, and executions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to address this issue, in June 2020, the House of Representatives in the Philippines passed a bill called Anti-Terrorism Bill. The current President of the Philippines, namely, Rodrigo Duterte certified this bill as an ‘urgent’ one, with the aim to respond to the threat in the country. However, this bill has been subject to a lot of criticism, demonstrations, and protests among politicians, religious organizations, civilians, and celebrities as well. They believe that the Anti-Terrorism Bill will infringe human rights and other civil liberties in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines is a South Asian Archipelagic State. It is the unitary Presidential Constitutional Republic, where the President acts both as the head of State and of Government.</p>



<h4><strong>Current Legal Scenario</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>What is Anti- Terrorism Act?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The Anti-Terrorism Bill was sent by Presidential Spokesperson for the President’s assent and was signed into Action by the president on the 3rd of July. It aims to protect the country from Domestic and Foreign Terrorist Attacks. The Act states that “any law enforcer to arrest and detain without warrant ‘a person suspected of committing any of the acts’ punishable under the major for 14 calendar days, extendable by 10 days and the suspected “terrorists” can also be placed under surveillance for 60 days, extendable by up to 30 more days, by the police or military”. This Act also removed the provision of the previous Act which provided that the acquitted suspects who were arrested without a warrant to recover damages from the police for every day that he or she was detained. Further, the new Act regulates discourse of terrorism that, in the Philippines, the government uses to invalidate dissent, which is coming from Leftists and Communists.<img loading="lazy" width="602" height="400" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UB-pZrP977zHkLQNZPZ8dnkqE3cWg86oXPME8wrJW1bjcqDmfBdspmNuhYT9kFQnhtdtHb60YzLVdxldH7FYVfKT16iRSrzUn9cVJ5MaGIMZMdQuEBGMA3pTQUdQfGG6c47KIg"></p>



<p>It had never been seen in the history of the Philippine that the government authorized police to use such power over commoners. Also, police were earlier at least considering the consequences of arresting suspects without reason. But, now the police do not need to consider the same.</p>



<p><strong>According to the new Act, anyone among the following can be labeled as a ‘terrorist’:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Who engages in acts intended to cause death or serious physical injury to another person.</li><li>Who engages in acts intended to cause extensive damage to a government or public facility, place, or private property.</li><li>Who engages in acts intended to damage critical infrastructure.</li><li>Who develops, possesses, acquires, transports, or uses deadly explosive weapons.</li><li>Who releases dangerous substances, causes fire or floods with the aim to intimidate the public, government, or International organization.&nbsp;</li><li>Who is accused of inciting, conspiring, proposing, and participating in training, planning, and facilitation of terrorist attacks?</li></ol>



<p>Moreover, the Court of Appeals can declare any individual or organization as ‘terrorists’ in 72 hours, upon application from the Department of Justice. Those found guilty will be imprisoned for life without Parole.</p>



<p>As long as advocacy, work stoppages, and humanitarian action is done “without intention to cause physical harm or death to a person, to endanger a person’s life, or to create a serious risk to public safety”; they are exempted from the definition of terrorism. The attributability for law enforcement agents has also been relaxed, who may breach the rights of the accused, particularly those in detention.</p>



<h4><strong>Why was this Act Needed?</strong></h4>



<p>The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 is the amended version of the Human Security Act, which was enacted by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2007, in order to tackle militants in the Southern Philippines. The Act has been put forth in order to battle Asia’s longest Communist insurgency, by the Communist Party of the Philippines, known as the New People’s Army (NPP), and a thirty years reign of terror by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). In 2017, Marawi, a Southern city of the Philippines was subjected to siege by Islamic state-aligned militants. Even, last year the Southern region of the country was jolted by a suicide bombing, allegedly conducted by a militant group known as Islamic State in Sulu (IS Sulu). </p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="286" height="190" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WeM1OIAMWVgrWNRNoOS0Mjr0RA8eYJnQuzIxUVeeoE8qSzyUIl6vGFLrY1IDapvaGfHMpcR9JfOoUp2mRAfDwhgw4wwSr3DTR0sv6JQcAO5-nczCnm6Ys9IQeE84BLiBQoXLJQ"></p>



<p><em>These insurgencies have adversely affected the economic sector in the countryside, hampered investments, and have resulted in cross-fires</em>.</p>



<p>Lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic also did not stop the terror, as reported that more than 6,000 people were evacuated from the country&#8217;s southern region. Where, Communist rebels’ and Islamic militants attacked soldiers, who were securing distribution of financial aid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proponents of the Act are of the opinion that due to the leniency for the offenders and a lot of restrictions on the law enforcer, the previous act has not been efficient enough to curb terrorism. Further, the Act provides the administration with immense power to deal with these security challenges. It expands the range of punishable acts to include preparatory and mobilization activities for the commission of terrorism. &nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="578" height="420" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tyRjXWxgyeRVSDnD4GZjUgACXLp1cbWZsP8h3IQrtDZ7FOhSyhuagVIAD2dPUWwV_wcUi6vXa7JMT7CsH0FxvdL2MlAQEBOoo5yJLbU0lWRRxse59ItCFsIpvXkI08WjYUuIhw"></p>



<h4><strong>Why is this Act a Problem?</strong></h4>



<p>The new Anti-Terrorism Act is opposed because of the following reasons:</p>



<ul><li>The Philippines Commission on Human Rights is of the opinion that the wide definition of terrorism in the new Act makes a way for possible abuse. Critics of the Act pointed to a recent example where the government used the force of law against civilians who were voicing displeasure over dealing with coronavirus by the administration as proof that Duterte’s government could misuse this vague definition.&nbsp;</li><li>Anti-Terrorism council which will be made up of top cabinet officials has been set up by the government in order to define what constitutes terrorism. This council can designate anyone and everyone as a terrorist.&nbsp;</li><li>The act may be a step for amelioration; however, the timing is not. It is a well-known fact that the world is struggling with the covid-19 and to address the problems of this pandemic must be the foremost priority of the administration. Rather than, coming up with a legal issue in these hard times.</li><li>The International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines warned that (ICHRP) there will be an escalation of rights abuses with the coming of the new law. The right to security and privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to due process will all be curtailed. All these rights are guaranteed to Filipinos by their constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other internationally agreed covenants that are signed by the Philippine.&nbsp;</li><li>Citizens fear that the new Act can be used against any critics, as it will restrain legitimate dissent, giving greater opportunities to authorities to curtail the rights of people without even holding them accountable.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Threat to Mindanao Minorities</strong></h4>



<p>An autonomous region in the south of the Philippines known as “Bangsamoro” is in transition after years of fighting between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Marawi siege delayed the passage of Bangsamoro basic law and hindered the harmonization across communities in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to several reports, due to a prolonged history of bias, the Muslim and Moro minorities are most vulnerable not only to terrorist attacks but to warrantless arrests under the guise of “counterterrorism”. Where Muslims are profiled as violent terrorists even today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, the women of Moro and Muslim minorities face heightened discrimination, especially the ones covering their heads. Instead of seeing widowed women and orphaned children (by conflict), as someone who can inform police for change, counter-terrorism makes police see them as vulnerable to being recruited in terrorism.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s believed that this Act will make it easier to target Muslims and undermine efforts of pacification.</p>



<h4><strong>Protests Against the Bill</strong></h4>



<p>Ever since the bill was proposed, there has been tension throughout the country. People from different human rights groups, educational institutes, and church organizations have come out on the streets and are protesting against this bill amidst the pandemic. Rallies have been carried out in the capital city Manila and other major cities as well. In spite of mass gatherings being prohibited, protest leaders reportedly said that they were compelled to come out on streets to save the country from crossing a dangerous line that violated their freedom of expression. Also, protests were carried out by thousands at the University of Philippines’ main campus at Manila. Here the protesters tried to maintain distance and all wore face masks as a safeguard, while holding placards and chanting slogans questioning the timing of the legislation.<img loading="lazy" width="566" height="362" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gh3zsG9qDI9pp30dYEviM-5iYUZ4e5sERJgeAMvdIkWJUOQvsBEFmQXhOYMav67-XDjoWkfZhSiJW_g2X1gBU6l9yQwdTVc64sQXnciZprXR2lHFVsX75yRg9-41RHulIojyIg"> In another university, situated in Cebu city, the Anti-terror bill rally was also carried out and it is reported that around 30 protestors were trapped inside the university for hours, few among which were arrested during the dispersal, even when the Act provides the right of peaceful protest to people. Some protestors stated the new Act as oppressive and such, which they believe will suppress their right to protest and speak against the wrongdoings of the society while subjugating their ministry of compassion, justice, and peace. Further, they opined that the government should have focussed on problems like poverty, food shortage, medical services, and unemployment instead.</p>



<h4><strong>Legal Challenges</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;The controversial Anti-Terrorism legislation is giving opportunities to opponents to raise immediate legal challenges before the Courts regarding the constitutionality of some of its provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report, an opposition Senator, among the two who voted against the bill is likely to make efforts to challenge it directly to the country’s highest court. Also, a former Supreme Court judge had earlier affirmed that as soon as this bill turns into law it can be questioned directly before the High Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reportedly, the lawyers were waiting for the President’s signature in order to file their legal challenge. Consequently, four petitions were quickly filed after the act was enacted before the Supreme Court, describing its provisions to be vague and violating Human Rights and constitutional principles.</p>



<p>These petitioners filed for the writ of certiorari and prohibition upholding a prayer for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) chairperson and its members. Two of the petitioners pleaded that the Supreme Court after following the procedure should annul the new act for being unconstitutional. While other petitioners only asked for nullification of some sections of the law.</p>



<h4><strong>Response of Government to the Challenges</strong></h4>



<p>According to the reports, in response to all the challenges President Duterte addressed the nationals to not be afraid of the new law. Further, saying that this bill is not a problem for law-abiding citizens and only those people should fear who are planning to bomb churches and public utilities to frustrate the nation.</p>



<p>More than 40,000 people’s lives have been put to an end due to the conflict between the government and the armed wing of the communist party.</p>



<p>In addition to this, the government is of the opinion that people are misunderstanding the powers of the Anti-Terror Council as the council can designate individuals as terrorists only if they are:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Already designated as terrorists by United Nation Security Council in its list and</li><li>If there is evidence that a person may be a terrorist as defined by this law.</li></ol>



<p>The effect of designation does not lead to detention but the council can only forward such designation to the Anti-money laundering council, which will look into the assets. So, it is actually the courts of law through a whole judicial process that can see with certainty and beyond any reasonable doubt that a person or a group of persons are terrorists.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>The new anti-terrorism act has enhanced the power and discretion on its use. Now, the question remains will it be used with a high degree of rationality and attributability or not.</p>



<p>The country’s security agencies are facing trust issues while emphasizing the need to support reformists in these organizations to ramp up professionalization and capacity development and further training. Besides, the supporters of the act are working on the presumption that the security, executive, and judicial institutions would give regard to human rights and would exercise a vigorous degree of accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the contrary, the response of the citizens against the act could be inferred as an exhibition of reduced trust in government institutions given the task of anti-terrorism efforts. They want the government to revoke the act, reopen deliberations and listen to people across society, especially the ones who have been victims of both terrorist violence and abusive counter-terror laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, while any form of terrorism is intolerable, public security can never be at the expense of fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis across the globe, with an estimated 24 million people, which makes about 80 percent of the total population in grave need of humanitarian assistance including millions of children.<br>Yemen officially known as The Republic of Yemen is a nation situated at the Southern end of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia, covering the second largest part of the Arabian Peninsula as being a Sovereign State.<br>Since the conflict arose, civilians of Yemen have been the victim of bad governance, holding a range of unredressed grievances that include violence, attacks, arbitrary detentions, torture, and enforced disappearances. Moreover, humanitarian aid has been impeded from time to time, and problems such as violence against women, famine, poverty; diseases have taken a spike. The ongoing conflict has damaged the economy and infrastructure of the country on a larger scale, leading to the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe.</p>



<h4>Historical perspective: Yemeni Civil War</h4>



<p>In ancient times, Yemen was ruled by Sabaeans, which prospered as a trading state for centuries altogether. Later, the Jewish influenced Himyarite Kingdom came into existence. Religions, primarily Christianity and Islam, grew rapidly in the 4th and 7th centuries, respectively. It can be seen that the administration of Yemen has long been in a state of turmoil, from the emergence of different dynasties to the unification of Northern and Southern Yemen, forming the present Republic of Yemen.<br>To begin with, the conflict of Yemen has its roots in the non-fulfillment of political transition supposed to bring firmness following an Arab Spring uprising that forced its long-time president, Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over his power to his deputy Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. But unfortunately, Mr. Hadi could not deal with many problems such as separatist movement in the south, attacks by jihadists, unemployment, corruption, food shortage, etc. Besides, a Houthi movement known as Ansar Allah led by Yemen’s Zaidi- Shia Muslim minority, fought several rebellions against Saleh and took advantage of Hadi’s inability by taking the northern province of Saada and vicinity under control.<br>Disillusioned with the transition, many Yemeni Sunnis supported Houthi, and later the rebellions gradually took over the capital city Sana’a. As a result of which two groups came into existence: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi &#8211; led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement along with their allies and supporters, both claiming to establish the official government of Yemen.</p>



<p>Sana’a which is controlled by Houthi forces along with its allies who were loyal to the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh conflict with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Also, attacks have been carried out by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL). At the same time, the Hadi government had clashes with United Arab Emirates (UAE) forces as a result of their military measures. The Houthi led supreme revolutionary committee after taking over Sana’a along with its government declared a mobilization to topple Hadi and extend their control by conquering southern Yemen.<br>The Saudi-led bombing campaign has been criticized largely by people at large which has resulted in the mass killing of civilians as per the Yemen data project.<br>Furthermore, according to a report, the Saudi led coalition attacked Houthi Saleh forces in support of President Hadi. As the war continued, alliances broke, and Saleh was assassinated in a clash. Consequently, war broke out between UAE backed Yemeni forces in Aden and Yemeni government forces due to which civilians suffered a spiraling economic crisis, lack of essential services, broken governance, health, education, and judicial systems.</p>



<h4><strong>Crisis in Yemen: Major Reasons</strong></h4>



<p>The intensity of the Crisis in Yemen can be understood with this, that even the delivery of much needed humanitarian aid is unlawfully impeded; the ongoing armed conflicts have affected the civilian population terribly, Airstrikes have been conducted by coalitions killing thousands of civilians. Moreover, Houthi forces recruited children, used banned landmines, and damaged major cities killing and injuring commoners. Activists and journalists have been threatened and harassed. Besides, Houthi forces have taken hostages, raped, and tortured detained migrants.<br>On the contrary, the imputability has been woefully inadequate even when there is much evidence of infringement of International law by the parties to the conflict.</p>



<p>●<strong> Unlawful Airstrike</strong><br>Human Rights Watch: An International non-governmental Organization has documented a number of airstrikes apparently conducted by the Saudi-led coalition, including deadly attacks on Yemen&#8217;s fishing boats. Further, it has been documented that, since the war began more than 20,100 airstrikes have been conducted on Yemen by a Saudi-led coalition that amounts to an average of 12 attacks a day. Destroying hospitals, market places, bridges, factories, detention centers, etc.</p>



<p>●<strong> Children and Armed Conflict</strong><br>According to a United Nation report on Yemen, all the parties to the conflict have used child soldiers under the age of 18 and 15 years, mostly recruited by Houthis.<br>The United Nation Secretary-General released an annual “list of shame” for violations against children in armed conflict, which has detailed that the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for the death and injury of 729 children, Houthis were responsible for the death of 398 children, and 58 children were killed and injured by Yemeni government forces. The irony here is that the secretary-general listed the Saudi-led coalition in this list on the one hand and categorized it as a step to improvisation on the other hand, despite the mounting evidence that these forces killed and harmed children on a larger scale.</p>



<p>● <strong>Arbitrary Detentions, Torture, and Enforced Disappearances.</strong><br>All the parties to the conflict in Yemen have arbitrarily detained people, abused them and subjected them to poor conditions, and forcibly abducted and disappeared people perceived to be political opponents or security threats.<br>It is evident from different reports that detention facilities controlled by UAE and UAE backed forces arbitrarily detained and tortured detainees, who are suspected to be members of ISIL and AQAP.<br>In the same way, Houthis have also been made responsible for dozens of cases of arbitrarily detaining and enforcing disappearances, while being subjected to torture and other ill-treatment which include beating with iron rods, rifles, and being hung from walls with their arms shackled behind them.<br>For these reasons, the female members of the families of the abducted men have protested in front of the prisons in major cities of Yemen hoping for their kidnapped sons, fathers, brothers to be searched, these have been grouped under a name which is “Mothers of Abductees Association”. This association reported the Disappearance of 3,478 cases, among which 128 were killed.<br>Not only this but, academicians, students, Politicians, Journalists, and other minority groups have reported being harassed by Houthis.</p>



<p>●<strong> Landmines</strong><br>Reportedly, Houthis have installed landmines throughout Yemen, such as anti-personnel mines, improvised explosive devices, and anti-vehicle mines along the western coast of Yemen, causing hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries. In addition to which, aid workers’ abilities to reach vulnerable people got obstructed. Their use has been documented in six governorates. Since the conflict arose, at least 140 civilians, including 19 children&#8217;s lives have been put to an end because of these landmines. While landmines have been planted in farmlands, roads, villages, and wells civilians access have been prevented especially farmers whose life completely depends upon crops and water. Demining efforts also face many problems.</p>



<p>● <strong>Famine</strong><br>Millions of people are starving in Yemen; half of them are suffering extreme levels of hunger or are a step away from famine. The percentage of famine cases is increasing year by year. Two-third of all districts in Yemen are already pre-famine. Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) reported that more than 85,000 civilians have died as a result of ongoing famine.<br>On the other hand, food shortage is gravely affecting IDPs and host communities, marginalized groups, landless wage laborers, and the fishing communities. In addition to this, it has been warned that more than 13 million Yemenis face starvation and that it could become “the worst famine in the world in 100 years”.</p>



<h4><strong>Need for Humanitarian Aid:</strong></h4>



<p>In order to survive, a large number of people seek humanitarian assistance. The situation is getting exacerbated year by year with the millions of Yemenis facing hunger, health issues, and other problems. Among the countries, 29 million inhabitants’, 24 million people need some sort of protection. While some have fewer needs, others have severe needs. Out of every 10 Yemeni civilians, more than 8 are in need of humanitarian aid, being the only option left with them.</p>



<h4><strong>Agreements by the Parties to the conflict:</strong></h4>



<p>The Peace talks in United Nations between the Houthis and the Yemeni government in December 2018, (when the special envoy of United Nations Secretary-General for Yemen brokered a cease-fire, known as the Stockholm Agreement) led to the termination of hostilities in the coastal towns of Hodeida, Salif, and Ras’ Issa. But, their agreement did not include other ground fightings and the new military funds.<br>The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi urged International scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s International Law infringements in Yemen and other states’ potential complicity in abuses through arms sales. Few European countries such as Norway, Finland, Netherlands, and Germany either reviewed or suspended their arms sales to members of the Saudi-led coalition, on the other hand, countries including the US, Canada, France, and Australia are still supplying military weapons.</p>



<h4>Governmental Initiatives:</h4>



<p>In terms of area, most part of Yemen is controlled by the official Yemen government. But, when it comes to population, major cities such as Sana&#8217;a and Sa&#8217;dah are controlled by Houthi forces. Thus, even if the government takes certain steps or initiatives, implementation becomes difficult.<br>As such, the vision of Yemen&#8217;s government is to elevate Yemen&#8217;s international ranking to that of a medium ‘human development’ country. While, trying to stop the growing threat of famine and negotiate with different nations to effectively try to unblock imports, ensure distribution of aid, and counteract a lack of foreign exchange in this nation. But, still, Yemen’s weak governance capacity and poor fiduciary environment have hampered its access to reach out to people in need. Reportedly, Yemen’s government is helpless, as the Houthis have seized most of its weapons during the coup. So, Due to the lack of resources, it is not able to cope up with the consequences of conflict.</p>



<h4><strong>What Can Be Done:</strong></h4>



<p>The conflict has had a polarizing impact on society at the local level. Thus, initiatives must be taken to help alleviate the crisis and they are as follows;</p>



<p>⮚ <strong>First</strong>, emphasis should be made on the importance of practical solutions. While easing the pressure on people with the help of humanitarian efforts and focusing on depoliticizing the supply of food and health care<br>⮚ <strong>Second</strong>, negotiations regarding the conflict and safe humanitarian access, and aid pipelines must be worked out by all the parties to the conflict. So, nations across the world should contest any efforts that allow Houthis to remain armed.<br>⮚<strong> Third</strong>, parties to the conflict must respect the international humanitarian law and have an obligation to take certain precautions to limit the impact of conflict on civilians.<br>⮚<strong> Fourth</strong>, the government must ensure that public sector workers are paid salaries so that the continuation of essential services is not hindered.<br>⮚<strong> Fifth</strong>, diplomatic channels should remain open and humanitarian financing and action needs to be impartial and neutral.<br>⮚ <strong>Sixth</strong>, a bit can be done by individuals across the globe by donating through the number of organizations and foundations working for this cause.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>It cannot be denied that for years, the United Nations and its partners have been trying to protect the people of Yemen. For example, each month, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) distributes 1 lac metric tons of food, which reaches more than 8 million Yemenis; The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has provided cholera vaccines to more than 3 lac people; United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)has provided reproductive health services to 2,50,000 women, and the United Nation Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) works with the government at all levels to increase coordination and betterment.<br>Despite this, the conflict of Yemen is multifaceted and characterized by deep mistrust. Virtually, everyone in Yemen has been the victim of this destructive armed conflict and the past five years have left the people completely exhausted.<br><br></p>
