<h3><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong>:</h3>



<p> The unwavering conflict between Israel, the world&#8217;s only Jewish state, and Palestine, consisting of the Arab population, sparked up the most controversial and polarizing issues within modern-day international politics, essentially over the power dispute in deciding who gets what part of the geographical land.</p>



<p><strong>Palestine</strong> is located at the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea, to the west of Jordan and south of Lebanon, consisting of Jordan valley and Ghawr, mountains and hills, southern desert, coastal and inner plains, whereas Israel is located at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean sea in west Asia, In the south, it has a small coastal line on the Red sea. It is surrounded by Egypt from the southwest, Syria from the northeast, Lebanon from the north, and Jordan from the east. (Please consider the map for a clear idea).</p>



<p>The unresolved conflict between the two countries fighting for the right to attain peaceful statehood existence, within the same geographical region of the middle east, began in the early 20th century. But it can be dated back to thousands of years when the Jews fled from persecution in Europe wanting to establish a state of their own. Still, it was resisted by the Arabs who saw the land as rightfully as their own As a result of which several wars were fought, with the majority of wars being among those fought in the year 1948 and 1967. The war of 1967 is of great importance so far as the current situation is concerning because it transferred the west bank and Gaza strip under the control of Jews.</p>



<p>The continuous string of wars between the two parties has to lead to a situation very difficult to resolve. It was difficult to make the west bank, which was essentially a part of Palestine, occupied by the Israeli military in 1967 along with East Jerusalem and Gaza strip, a part of an independent Palestine, which was the first and the foremost demand of the Palestinians because Israel had built settlements and constructed barriers which formed a de-facto border, making it difficult to decide, which part of the Jerusalem shall belong to, as both sides claim it to be their center. The dispute between the two sides regarding refugees is yet another crucial issue that needs thorough introspection. Therefore, the central conflict is essential regarding the Holy land, which is of greater religious, cultural, and political importance to both the parties in the disagreement.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Holy Land</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&nbsp;The term holy land usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern state of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and of southwestern Syria. The city of Jerusalem is sacred to many religious traditions, including the Abrahamic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which consider it a holy city. Some of the most sacred places for each of these religions are found in Jerusalem, and the one shared between all three is the Temple Mount.</p>



<p>Jerusalem has been considered the holiest city in&nbsp;<strong>Judaism</strong>&nbsp;and the Jewish people&#8217;s ancestral and spiritual homeland since the 10th century BC. It is given such a special status in Jewish law that Jews outside Jerusalem pray facing its direction and believe that God promised the land to the children of Abraham i.e., Israelis and hence the claim.</p>



<p>So far as the&nbsp;<strong>Islamic</strong>&nbsp;stand is concerned, Jerusalem is the sacred site along with Mecca and Medina because it is believed that the previous prophets of Islam had a close affiliation with the city and even the last messenger of Islam, Prophet Mohammad (saw) visited the city on a nocturnal journey. Besides that, it is also regarded as the first qibla and hence holds a great significance for Muslims in general and the inhabitants of Palestine in particular.</p>



<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>



<p> The conflict between the two countries gathered gravity in 1917 when the official support of Britain was extended to the Jewish National home in Palestine by Arthur James Balfour, then British Foreign Secretary, whose support was seen as ignoring the rights of Arabs of Palestine, which ultimately led to violence. When Britain was not able to control the fuelling of the violence, it withdrew its forces from Palestine in 1948, the time when the United Nations was created. Hence the matter is now to be resolved by the United Nations itself by taking into consideration the rights and claims of both the parties in the conflict.</p>



<p>The United Nations took its first in an attempt to solve the problem by presenting a partition plan which proposed to create separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine. The plan was accepted by most of the Jews but rejected by Arabs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, When Israel declared its independence in 1948, a war took place between the two states the outcome of which was that Israel controlled about 50% of more territory than was suggested by the UN. Jordan controlled the west bank, Jerusalem holy sites, and Egypt controlled Gaza, but the Jews were removed from inside of Gaza by Israel in 2005; however, it maintained tight control at the border crossing.</p>



<p>Shortly after in the year 1967, another war took place between Arabs and Israeli, where Israel seized Golan Heights from Syria, the west bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza strip from Egypt. Currently, the west bank is nominally controlled by the Palestinian authority but is under Israeli occupation in the sense that the Israeli troops enforce security Restrictions and the Gaza strip is the control of Hamas, an Islamist fundamentalist party with no ground troop occupation.</p>



<p>The year 1975 proved to be significant for Palestinians as the UN in year 1975 gave observer status to the Palestine liberation organization (PLO)and recognized the<strong> Palestinians&#8217; right to self-determination</strong> but irrespective of this recognition, violence continued between the two which led to the formation of Hamas in 1987, which is an offshoot of Egypt&#8217;s Muslim brotherhood seeking to free Palestine by jihad. It was in this year only when the tension in occupied territories of the west bank and Gaza reached a crucial point which led to the first intifada i.e. a war between Palestinian militants and the Israeli army.</p>



<p>After the grave violence which led to the wastage of thousands of innocent lives on both sides, PLO and Israel agreed to recognize each other and renounced violence under an accord called Oslo Accords in 1993 which led to the establishment of the<strong> Palestinian Authority</strong> which later received autonomy in some parts of the west bank and the Gaza strip.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Current Situation</strong></h4>



<p>  After the gulf war against Kuwait, where Palestinians supported Iraq, Palestinians lost financial and military support from Arabs(Zahler Reuben Israel Palestinian conflict, Oregon Hillel Eugene OR20 Nov 2014 lecture). Still, since the international community has recognized the problem of a Palestinian refugee, western nations came forward for support.</p>



<p>As far as the negotiation is concerned, more rounds of negotiation occurred like the one led by then US president Bill Clinton which is the camp David ii, but this too didn&#8217;t fructify and was followed by intifada second, &#8220;the Al-Aqsa&#8221; intifada which erupted between the two parties in the year 2000 which left severe and deep imprints in the entire region. By 2003, 2,400 Palestinians and 800 Israelis have died, leaving hundreds more wounded and traumatized (Bunton martin p. the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a very short introduction Np,97 print).</p>



<p>The former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon sought to disrupt the Palestinian authority&#8217;s economic and physical infrastructure (ibid.) Israel deployed tanks, helicopters, and troops in Palestinian territories. The aim of Ariel Sharon, the then Prime Minister, was to separate the Israeli from Palestinians and not opt for any negotiations.</p>



<p>The largely tumultuous decade of the 2000s resulted in more radical threats and further insecurity, intense military retaliation, and continual hardship for a daily Palestinian. When we consider the Gaza strip&#8217;s violence, there occur semi-frequent conflicts like the 2008 Israel-Gaza war, 2012 conflict, and the war of 2014, which usually resulted in protests across <strong>the west bank, IDF bombings, and ground invasions in Gaza</strong>, among other violations.</p>



<p>The Israeli Govt. has taken a strict stand so far as its dealings with the Palestinians are concerned within the scope of international humanitarian law because it continues to impose unjustifiable restrictions on Palestinian human rights, not allowing the moment of goods and people in and out of Gaza strip and by allowing the Israeli citizens to settle in the occupied Gaza strip. Gaza&#8217;s restrictions resulted in <strong>limited access to educational institutions, medical care</strong>, economic and other opportunities, clean water, and electricity, and basic needs, which left 80% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid.</p>



<p>The international human rights standards continue to be violated at Israeli forces&#8217; hands by firing live ammunition at peaceful demonstrators in Gaza and open fire operations. According to Al-Mezan, a Palestinian rights group, Israeli forces <strong>killed 34 Palestinians</strong>, and <strong>1883 were injured </strong>with live ammunition during the protests in 2019 as per the Gaza health ministry. These violations also resulted in unlawful attacks and civil casualties on both sides.</p>



<p>According to Israeli Group Peace Now, in 2019, plans for 5995 housing units in west bank settlements were approved by Israeli authorities, excluding east Jerusalem as compared to 5618 in 2018.</p>



<p> Israel&#8217;s cabinet officials approved the ex-post-facto, the outpost settlement of Mevo&#8217;ot Yericho in the Jordan valley, something that is illegal even under Israeli law. Besides that,<strong> the Israeli authorities also destroyed 504 Palestinian homes</strong> and other structures, while they with no construction permit in East Jerusalem or the West bank have given it under their control.</p>



<p><strong>According to the UN office of the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the demolitions displaced 642 people.</strong></p>



<p>Israel responds to the launching of rockets or incendiary balloons from Gaza, resulting in civilians&#8217; casualties by restricting Gaza&#8217;s access to territorial waters for fishers, closing Israel crossings to Gaza, slashing fuel imports to the Gaza power plant as a punishment.</p>



<h4><strong>Stand of the International Community</strong></h4>



<p>As far as the international community is concerned, different countries are being shown regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue.<strong> The US has recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights</strong>, which imposed and expanded aid cuts to the west bank and Gaza including the USAID projects, declaring that the US does not consider the Israeli settlements to violate international humanitarian law. The US states also penalized the global tourism company Airbnb under anti-boycott laws for its pledge to remove listings from Israeli settlements in the west bank from its website, and hence it reversed its pledge.</p>



<p>The European Union criticized the demolition in Sur Baher, Jerusalem, and the Israelis politician Netanyahu&#8217;s promise to annex the Jordan valley.</p>



<p>Even the prosecutor of the international criminal court, instead of commencing a probe into the Palestinian situation, requested the court&#8217;s ruling about the matter that Palestine is a state, for the jurisdiction of the concerned court concerning the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>



<p>In Feb. 2020, <strong>US President Donald Trump announced a controversial peace plan</strong> for the region that would legalize Israeli settlements in the west bank and East Jerusalem, allowing annexation of the parts of the west bank while Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel.</p>



<p>This proposal was rejected by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on the basis that this plan will not bring peace or stability to the region as it annuls the legitimacy of Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination. He said that it is an Israeli- American plan to put an end to Palestine&#8217;s question. But the Israeli ambassador Danny Danon considered this approach as a sane plan to end the longstanding conflict.</p>



<p>The US envoy Mr. Mladenov expressed hope that the ambassador will support the Secretary General&#8217;s call for negotiation for the conflict&#8217;s solution. He held that &#8220;in the absence of the credible path back to negotiations, we all face a heightened <strong>risk of violence</strong>. Violence, which will drag both peoples and the region to a spiral of escalation with no end in sight&#8221;.</p>



<p> As far as the world&#8217;s stand, with regard to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, is concerned, the bitter truth is the <strong>legitimacy of Israel</strong> is recognized by the non-Muslim countries who maintain diplomatic relations with it. But some of them have taken an unbiased stand and have criticized the Israelis treatment of the Palestinians and its occupation of the west bank.</p>



<p>&nbsp;When we look at the global public opinion, we realize that it is more sympathetic to Palestine, which has created a concern among the Israelis that the international boycott moment called BDS could pick up some support. This moment, which was initiated in 2005, aims to capitalize on Israel&#8217;s international anger by creating costs to Israel Palestinian policy through (BDS), i.e. boycotting Israeli goods and institutions, divestment from Israeli companies, and sanctions on the nation itself. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drags on, many Israelis worry that BDS will become more mainstream. It is believed that BDS could be a real problem for Israel if it fails to come to terms with Palestinians.</p>



<p>One of the crucial things that have become the <strong>cause of Israel&#8217;s poor global standing</strong> <strong>is the west bank</strong> because most countries believe that the continuous Israeli occupation of the west bank is an unlawful military occupation which violates the fourth Geneva convention (reference) which is justified by Israel by stating that it isn&#8217;t occupied. Even if it were, it doesn&#8217;t violate the fourth Geneva convention because it prohibits forcible population transfers, not a voluntary settlement. </p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Mahatma Gandhi, one of the peace-loving politicians of the Indian Nation has said &#8220;I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary. The evil it does is permanent &#8220;and when we consider this saying concerning the crises in any part of the world be it Syria, Rohingya, Palestine, Kashmir or any other conflicted area, one common thing is that it gets reflected on the eye of our mind, no matter how long-term the violence might be, its desired outcome never fructifies simply because power is violence and the more one tries to suppress a just cause illegally, the more such reasons will flourish. Therefore, parties to the conflict should realize this simple principle before it&#8217;s too late and should try to recognize each other in a rightful and fairway. As far as the Palestine-Israel is concerned, keeping in view of the unending devastation and grave violations of fundamental human rights, it&#8217;s high time for both of the parties to say no to violence, which is not going to be fruitful to any one of them instead of trying to resolve the issue more amicably and peacefully considering the emotional aspect and rights of both the sides. Besides, it is also vital for the International community to take an unbiased stand and contribute to the dispute&#8217;s just and fair settlement. Meanwhile, the UN is highly duty-bound to perform the function for which it was created and stop being a diplomatic, mute spectator, thereby contributing to global peace and security.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Every welfare state is duty-bound to come to the rescue of an oppressed class by the enactment of social welfare legislation or legislations aiming at positive discrimination. During ancient times, the laws in the place were not sufficient enough to fully protect the rights and interests of women folk. However, with the advancement of Society, this gender was also recognized and accepted as equally important, and for their protection, various laws were enacted but soon were those welfare legislations misused by some chronic and wicked accusers who impose allegations on some innocent persons for material, emotional or social gains.<br>Such laws aiming at maintaining balance and equality in society may be misused by any person against any other person. However, most of the cases of such nature are filed by a woman against a man, but that does not mean, allegations are not levied against a woman under the grab of protection provided by such laws.</p>



<h4>Impact of a False Accusation of Sexual Violence</h4>



<p>The issue of the intensity of false accusation and allegations of sexual assault may be regarded as the major controversial dispute which affects the phenomenon of retaliation for violence against women. On account of the presumption of Law, every Accused is deemed to be innocent until the offense is proved against him. Still, the reaction of society in such cases is that, without giving heed to the legal process of providing the offense and having faith in the Judicial system, people start victimizing such person and treat him with hatred and humiliation which unfortunately makes his mixing in the society difficult, affects his employment his personal life and hence hurdles his rehabilitation.<br>The result of this accusation is that it has got a tremendous devastating and destructive impact on the Accused even when the allegations do not lead to criminal sanctions vitally because once the person is accused of this offense, he is deemed to be convicted even before his guilt is proved in the court of law.</p>



<h4>Role of Media</h4>



<p>Media plays an important role whenever someone is accused of any sexual violence-related case, which ultimately worsens the trauma and humiliation. Media has the potential to highlight any issue and to circulate it in such a way that the person(s) involved in such case becomes known to everyone and when the person so involved is accused of an offense, it puts his/her emotional, mental, physical wellbeing at stake within no time.<br>Whenever any person is accused of any such offense, the media Uses its potential to put the accused in a non-judicial trial by circulating his pictures and amplifies the audacity of the problem meanwhile without considering its pros and cons as a result of which it becomes very difficult for him to re-establish his damaged reputation.<br>For this reason, mainly, most of the accusations are falsely levied so that the Accuser may on one side, attain attention, publication, or any other material gains, and on another side, the Accused may be humiliated and that he/she may suffer losses of whatever nature.</p>



<h4>Causes of False Accusations</h4>



<p>False accusation of sexual violence is reporting of the offense of sexual violence when no violence has taken place, the causes of false accusation fall broadly into two main categories;<br><strong>False memories:</strong> Which may occur because of and is not limited to, recovered memory therapy, memory conformity, and victims confusion; or,<br><strong>Lies:</strong> The person claiming to be a victim may implicate any person alleged of an offense into a false accusation of sexual violence to satisfy her personal grudges and may have several other motivations for such allegations.<br>An accuser may have the following motivations behind such false allegations;<br>• <strong>Revenge: </strong>The accuser may do so with the aim to damage the reputation, finances, and freedom of the alleged accused.<br>• <strong>Material gain:</strong> It may be done with the aim of obtaining material benefits, professional Promotion or to receive money.<br>•<strong> Attention:</strong> The Accuser may sometimes do so with the aim of receiving the attention of any kind.<br><strong>• Producing an alibi:</strong> This allegation may sometimes be used to cover up any other behavior like being late or absent to an appointment.<br>• <strong>Sympathy:</strong> It may be done by the Accuser for the purpose of seeking a special kind of attention to improve a personal relationship with an individual.<br>•<strong> Relabeling:</strong> Sometimes the consensual sex is relabeled as Rape either because of family pressure or because of its shameful character and hence the false complaint.<br>• <strong>Regret: </strong>It may so happen that sometimes after consensual sex, because of shame or negative feelings, the Accuser either willfully or because of the pressure of others may file a complaint against the alleged Accused.</p>



<h4>Scenario in Asia</h4>



<p>The problem of a false accusation of sexual violence is prevalent everywhere but considering Asia, it can be said that the feminist or #MeToo moment has tremendously gathered gravity and has been misused in such a manner that men usually avoid mixing with women for fear of false accusations.<br>In Asian countries, marriage is considered pious and is usually related to religion. However, weddings are another social aspect of such allegations. First, the allegations hit the domestic life of a person, his/her spouse is the worst affected and the relationship takes a severe beating Like, With the rise of Feminism in China, the #Metoo moment gathered importance but this moment was soon misused by the Accusers. The first #Metoo case in China, which may be regarded as one of the most important cases in Chinese history was that of Ms. Wang, who accused her former boss of sexually harassing her. But the outcome of this trial was that, in the end, it was Ms. Wang who was required to defend herself.</p>



<p>Though the stringent laws have been enacted so as to prevent crime against women but a dishonorable trend of filing false cases is prevalent in Asia, rendering the laws dealing with the protection of women and aiming at gender justice as a tool of manipulation. Hence the definition of Feminism has, in fact, become fascism.<br>The devastating impact of this new trend of false accusations is that it weakens the legitimate object of Feminism. The women who file false and frivolous cases get the support of such groups who actually help the women genuinely victimized. Since it’s usually a woman who files such a false and frivolous case against a woman or a man and thereby compromises the object of achieving the equality and mutual comprehension between genders, sought to be achieved by such groups and hence it delegitimizes the efforts of Feminism altogether.<br>For instance, shocking statistics have been presented by the Delhi Commission of women which shows that 53.2% of the rape cases between 2013 to 2014 in Delhi were false. The fact that the cases so filed with the police authorities are half true and half false brings into light the fact that the rectification of the society has materialized changes in that aspect.</p>



<h4>Current Situation</h4>



<p>The innocent Accused are gaining some consciousness and becoming somewhat aware of the possible way outs and hence we can see few cases of defamation against accusers or those involved in their humiliation, however, the idea of defamation lawsuits is yet to be discovered fully as there is very less awareness about it and even if some people are aware of it, they dare not to file such lawsuits for fear of tough procedure of proving one&#8217;s innocence in such cases.<br>Hence, it can be said that though there are accusers ready to misuse the feminist moment, #Metoo moment, or any other moment that actually aims at bringing about gender equality, the innocent accused persons are gathering the courage to challenge such allegations and prove the truth.</p>



<h4><strong>Scheme of Law</strong></h4>



<p>When we look at the laws and the punishments related to sexual offenses, we realize that very strict law has been kept in place and very stringent punishment provided for the same but while framing those laws, no regard has been given to the fact that if such a law gets misused what will be the way out.<br>No direct law dealing with the offense of false accusation of sexual violence has been passed by any country in Asia but the shield can be taken under the umbrella of provisions dealing with defamation.<br>For instance, the Defamation law in India which provides a remedy to the innocent Accusers runs as follows:<br>In case of filing any false complaint or presentation of false evidence so as to prosecute an innocent person or if any such intention exists<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Following charges can be framed against the Accuser in India under Indian Penal Code:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Section182: False information with the intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person;</strong><br>Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant-<br>(a)To do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or<br>(b)To use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, Shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term Which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.</p>



<p>Hence, if a person has provided any information to the police which is false and has deliberately Provided to the police in order to trigger wrongful proceedings on to the Other person out of vengeance so as to cause mental harassment to the said person, he shall be dealt with by mandating a punitive quantum which may extend to 6 months.</p>



<p><strong>Section186: Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions</strong>.<br>Whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his<br>Public functions shall be punished with imprisonment of either<br>Description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine<br>Which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.</p>



<p><strong>Section191: Giving false evidence.</strong><br>Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence.</p>



<p><strong>Section192: Fabricating false evidence.<br></strong>Whoever causes any circumstance to exist or makes any false entry in<br>Any book or record, or makes any document containing a false statement, Intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by Law before a public servant as such, or before an arbitrator and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding, is said: “to fabricate false evidence”.</p>



<p><strong>Section193: Punishment for false evidence</strong>.<br>Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and Shall also be liable to fine, and whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>

<p><strong>Section196: Using evidence known to be false.</strong><br>Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true or genuine evidence<br>Any evidence which he knows to be false or fabricated shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave or fabricated false evidence.</p>



<p><strong>Section199: False statement made in declaration which is by law receivable as evidence.</strong><br>Whoever, in any declaration made or subscribed by him, which Declaration any Court of Justice, or any public servant or another person, is bound or authorized by law to receive as evidence of any fact, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, touching any point material to the Object for which the declaration is made or used, shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave false evidence.</p>



<p><strong>Section200: Using as true such declaration knowing it to be false.</strong><br>Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true any such declaration, knowing the same to be false in any material point, shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave false evidence.</p>



<p><strong>Section211: False charge of offense made with the intent to injure.<br></strong>Whoever, with intent to cause injury to any person, institutes or causes to be instituted any criminal proceeding against that person, or falsely Charges any person with having committed an offense, knowing that there is no just or lawful ground for such proceeding or charge against that person shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.</p>



<p>And if such criminal proceeding be instituted on a false charge of an<br>An offense punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>



<p><strong>Section 340 of Code of Criminal Procedure,</strong> The law states that there are two conditions subject to which a complaint can be filed against a person who has given false affidavit or false evidence in a Proceeding before a court.<br>Firstly, the person has given a false affidavit in a Proceeding before the court and,<br>Secondly, in the opinion of the court, it is expedient in the interest of justice to make, an inquiry against such a person in relation to the offense committed by him.<br>Furthermore, a notice is issued to certain police officers under this section for an inquiry to determine if false evidence was fabricating records and Putting up a false case. Besides, the person may also be charged with the civil liability of wasting the time of police.</p>



<p>Likewise, the law directly dealing with false accusations of sexual violence has not yet been enacted in China and the remedies are sought under the Defamation Laws. However, the Chinese defamation law is not specifically spelled out as such but has been developed from Articles 101 and 102 of the General Principles of the Civil Law (enacted in 1987), and several subsequent supporting documents: the Supreme People’s Court’s Answers to Certain Issues Concerning Trials of Cases Involving the Right to Reputation (released in 1993), Understanding and Application of the 1993 Answers, Interpretation of Certain Issues Concerning Trials of Cases Involving the Right to Reputation (released in 1998), and Understanding and Application of the 1998 Interpretation.</p>



<p><strong>As explained in the 1993 Answers, defamation exists if</strong><br>i. The defendant has committed an illegal act,<br>ii. The plaintiff’s reputation has been damaged, and<br>iii. The illegal act caused damage.</p>



<p><strong>Such defamation exists in three circumstances:</strong></p>



<p>• Written or oral insults or libel that damages a person’s reputation;<br>• Unauthorized disclosure of personal information that damages a person’s reputation; or<br>• A news report containing “gross error” that damages a person’s reputation.</p>



<p>In Understanding and Application of the 1993 Answers, the SPC clarified that truth was NOT a defense to defamation. If a work insults and damages a person’s reputation, it is defamatory regardless of whether it is true.</p>



<p>The 1993 Answers state that either the allegedly defamed person or their close relatives (defined as spouses, parents, children, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren) have standing to sue. That rules out almost anyone alive from 1950 onward as a character that can is included without fears of liability.</p>



<p>Similar is the case with other Asian countries where Defamation laws are resorted to in case of false accusations of sexual violence. Hence it can be said that there is a dire need for the Asian countries to come forward and enact direct laws in order to fully protect the basic human rights of wronged persons.</p>



<h4>Modus Operandi</h4>



<p>Be it a man or woman, dignity is something which is precious to everybody and if a person falsely accuses another person of any sexual offense, his victimization is going to prove humungous. Usually, the responses to alleged sexual offenses become erroneous in the absence of witnesses when the court has to rely entirely on the statement of the complainant and corroborative forensic evidence which Is largely impacted by the prevailing cultural discourse and preconceptions about sexual predators and their victims.<br>Furthermore, the value to be attributed to the statement of alleged Accused will be lesser than the value and importance attributed to the statement of the supposed victim even in cases where the evidence only consists of testimony from the alleged victim and is strongly rebutted by the alleged perpetrator, the moral imperative not to let down another victim or to leave a possible sex offender free to cause further harm may be compelling (Webster, 1998; 2005). Though evidence and conduct do provide a light on the correct state of affairs the problem arises when the act that was initially consensual but was purported to be non-consensual.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>When we look back at history, we see every possible reason for the enactment of such laws that provide for positive discrimination and for the emergence of the movements like feminism, the #MeToo movement, the formation of women’s commission, and the like.<br>But by and by not only does a woman misused this law against a man but there are some cases where it has also been misused against a woman and hence this is the law that has been used for gross violation of the basic human rights in general and the right to dignity, life, health and prosperity in particular.</p>



<p>Laws which are there, for easy access to women can easily be misused, for some of the notorious women do not resist the temptation of teaching a lesson to the male members for some personal motives and hence file false and frivolous cases against a man and the same trend is observed in anti-dowry law which is being misused to such an extent that it has been termed as legal terrorism.<br>There are a plethora of cases where men are falsely implicated under women-centric laws which lead to public humiliation, torture, and extortion, and what magnifies this suffering is the delayed proceedings.<br>Therefore, there is a dire need for speedier remedies in such cases with the system of checks and balances to be introduced so as to prevent misuse of such laws and this is the right time for the government of all the countries to introduce suitable amendments to such laws so as to prevent its misuse and safeguard the rights and interest of innocent accused persons. Hence need for the hour is to have such a balanced system where women are protected and men are not unnecessarily harassed.</p>
