<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>



<p>Africa, being a large continent is prone to diverse issues and problems like high prevalence of communicable diseases, low incomes, malnutrition, poorly staffed services, low life expectancy and the like. The most crucial amongst such problems is mental health issues of children which remains unaddressed to a very large extent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of The major causes of growing psychological problems in the continent are increasing poverty, wars, natural disasters and other such sorts of violence and social unrest. It has been revealed that the element of depression alone is going to be the second biggest burden of all health conditions by 2030</p>



<p>In Africa, a plethora of mental health problems exist among children consisting of half of the population of the region. It is estimated that of the children aged between&nbsp; 0 to 9 years, about 3 % suffer from mental disorders. Many suffer from poor psychological development because of neglect either by their mothers or other caretakers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OF CHILDREN</strong></h3>



<p>Child and adolescent mental health is defined by the WHO as the capacity to achieve and maintain optimal psychological functioning and well being. It is directly related to the competence achieved and level reached in psychological and social functioning.</p>



<p>It includes an idea of identity and self-worth, sound family and peer relations, an ability to learn and be productive and capacity to use cultural resources and developmental challenges to maximize development.</p>



<p>However, if there are patterns or changes in thinking, behaving or feeling that causes distress or disrupts a person’s ability to function it implies mental illness or mental health disorder. The&nbsp; mental health disorder includes problems like disruptions or delays in developing age, inappropriate thinking, deviant behaviors, unregulated emotions or social skills which distress children and thereby disrupt their ability to function well in life.</p>



<p>In many African countries, the most usual presentation of psychosis is acute transient psychosis, paranoid psychosis and psychosis resulting from cerebral involvement in infectious diseases which produce temporary disability but may prove to be fatal if not treated properly.</p>



<p>The children growing up in such regions&nbsp; are usually exposed to extremely crucial experiences, who became hardly compatible with physical as well as emotional survival. Unless these toxic environments are addressed by the systems of care, improvement in the mental health of the children is a goal unachievable.</p>



<p>&nbsp;There are some human resources dedicated to the mental health of children. The pushes of the World Health Organization to include mental health in the millennium development goals have improved the profile of child mental health to a very large extent. However, there are certain challenges to the development of appropriate comprehensive child mental health services in Africa. The primary challenges say for instance are socio-economic circumstances and demographic complexities.</p>



<p>In Africa,both a formal as well as informal system of mental health care for children. Though the formal systems of care have been largely eroded by war or poverty but the informal system of care which includes care by family, by indigenous healers or NGO’s are to the large extent developed. For instance, the NGO&#8217;S like The Ape Action Africa, the Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), the Etijah and the like launch certain programs that provide a great help in addressing the issues of orphans and vulnerable and thereby come to the rescue of poor and mentally ill children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for proper care of needy children, both care systems are important and both must work together and complement each other as both are interdependent, for a formal care system can’t effectively address the issue having social context without consulting the informal system of care. Similarly the informal system of care depends on a formal system for specialized training and supervision.</p>



<h3>CURRENT SITUATION IN AFRICA</h3>



<p>In Africa, mental health problems have assumed greater attention. The continent&#8217;s population grew by 49% between 2000 to 2015&nbsp; and is expected to double by next three decades. There is constant pressure on young people who struggle to earn a livelihood in highly competitive labor markets. It is believed that they may face psychological problems because of their failure to realize ambitions or may turn to substance misuse for alleviating their frustrations.</p>



<p>The member states of the world health assembly in 2013, committed to the Mental Health Action Plan, whereby they pledged to enhance service coverage for severe mental health disorders by 20% by 2020 and to reduce suicide rates by 10%.</p>



<p>But the fact remains that health in general is still a poorly funded area of social services in most African countries, morality happening mostly by infectious diseases and malnutrition and morbidity and disablement due to mental illness receive little attention from the government. Mental services in particular continue to be poorly developed with no mental policies, programs or action plans.</p>



<h3>RELIEF PROGRAMS &amp; GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES</h3>



<p>The member states of the African region of the world health organization adopted two resolutions in 1988 and 1990 to improve mental health services with the main aim to formulate mental health policies, programs and action plans.</p>



<p>Two years later, a survey was conducted to see if the countries adopting the resolutions have done anything in this regard. Though there were some modest achievements yet the situation of mental health programs in most of the countries including Africa was unsatisfactory.</p>



<p>WHO in its African Regional Strategy for Mental Health in the year 2020, emphasized that populations in the African region are occupied by various mental and neurological disorders happening to be the major cause of disability. To address this issue, WHO is undertaking a large number of&nbsp; welfare projects with the aim to promote mental health services in Africa by strengthening mental health policies and implementing regional strategies to prompt mental health and thereby prevent mental, psychological and neurological disorders. In the long run, WHO intends to reduce disability associated with mental, psychological and neurological disorders through community based rehabilitation.</p>



<h3>HOW TO SOCIALLY UPLIFT THE AFFECTED?</h3>



<p>Mental disorders are counted among the top ten causes of disability in Africa the burden of which on health issues is going to rise making it inevitable to give this issue the attention and resources it needs.</p>



<p>While planning the system of child mental health care in Africa, two important factors that need to be taken into account include firstly, the moral value system&nbsp; and cultural specific world views of Africa, Asia, Arab and Caucasian people and secondly the social context in which children grow.</p>



<p>It is the need of the hour that authorities in power should develop psychiatry and mental health care. The mental health policies should be strengthened and regional strategies should be adopted and implemented to prompt mental health and mental, neurological and psychological disorders. The drug abuse related problems should be prevented. Community based rehabilitation is required to be launched for reducing disability associated with neurological, mental and psychoactive substances.</p>



<p>People’s perceptions are usually influenced by traditional beliefs in supernatural causes and remedies which leads to unhelpful or health damaging responses to mental illness and stigmatization of mentally ill persons. The negative perception of people as well as policy makers regarding mental and neurological disorders should be changed through various awareness programs and by formulating or reviewing existing legislation in support of mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equitable access should be provided to cost-effective mental, neurological and psychosocial care.</p>



<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>



<p>In order to improve the deteriorating situation of mental health services in Africa, there is dire for authorities to lay focus on the system of health care available for patients in general and children in particular. It should be the priority of the policy makers and authorities in power to make inpatient psychiatric services available at least for children suffering from psychiatric disorders.</p>



<p>Like other countries, the primary health care model has been adopted in Africa long ago but the mental health services were made vertical recently which however is largely based in mental hospitals, catering mainly for adults. Secondary and tertiary outpatient services for children have been started in some areas but only South Africa and Senegal have made inpatient Psychiatric services available for children.</p>



<p>when there is lack of general psychiatric services for children, Other sectors of medical care systems have correspondingly a greater responsibility in meeting mental health needs of patients in Africa and until the general psychiatric services are made available, other sectors are morally under the obligation to step forward and contribute to the humanitarian cause of coming to the rescue of helpless and devastated children. Disciplines like maternal and child health departments, pediatrics, schools, social welfare services, juvenile justice systems and prisons though general, fairly basic and non-specialized but are the obvious ones that have to play a role in contributing to the noble cause of maintaining the mental stability of children.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>



<p>Oceans make the most of the earth’s hydrosphere and 72 percent of the earth’s surface. It is a precious asset; a great source of biodiversity, a great contributor to social well-being, economic prosperity, and quality of life. </p>



<p>To govern the oceans and to ensure that maritime activities do not contaminate this resource, the United Nations through its several programs is trying to protect these. Also, the international law of the sea includes all kinds of legal frameworks regarding the sea and its applicability to inter-state relations.</p>



<h3>FREEDOM OF THE SEA</h3>



<p>Even before any law regarding seas came into being, Spanish and Portuguese claimed universal maritime dominion. However, the freedom of the sea doctrine came as a challenge to it. Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist, and philosopher was the propounder of the principle of the freedom of the seas (mare liberum). He defined the seas as being, like the air, limitless and therefore common to all. So, seas were declared to be free and belonging to none. This doctrine was strongly pressed by the great maritime and commercial powers. Besides, it remains one of the most fundamental concepts of the law of the sea and is now recognized to include freedom of fishing, laying of submarine cables and pipelines, navigation, and overflight of aircraft.</p>



<p>However, this notion limited the national rights and jurisdiction over the oceans surrounding a nation&#8217;s coastline. Subsequently, by the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, serious conflicts arose as coastal states started to demand custom zones for exclusive fishing rights and for the conservation of maritime resources found in their continental shelves.</p>



<h4>UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON LAW OF SEA</h4>



<p>The United Nations International Law Commission, upon the request of the International Community, began codifying the laws related to oceans in 1949 and prepared four draft conventions which were adopted by the United Nations at its first conference on the law of the sea.</p>



<h4>THE FIRST UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA ( UNCLOS I )</h4>



<p>The United Nations in 1958 convened its first conference on the law of the sea which was attended by eighty-two states. UNCLOS 1 adopted four conventions :</p>



<ol><li>The Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone,</li><li>The Convention on the High Seas,</li><li>The Convention on&nbsp; Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, and</li><li>The Convention on the Continental Shelf.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Although it was a positive step towards the development of the law of the sea still, there were many loopholes in the convention like the breadth of the territorial sea belonging to the states was not decided under it.</p>



<h4><strong>THE SECOND UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (UNCLOS II)</strong></h4>



<p>This conference which was held in 1960 did not result in any international agreements as it once again failed to fix a uniform breadth of the territorial sea or arrive at a consensus on sovereign fishing rights.</p>



<h4><strong>THE THIRD UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (UNCLOS III)</strong></h4>



<p>Finally, in the 11<sup>th</sup> session, a conference was held in 1982 to deal with different drawbacks of the previous conventions. It has resolved many important issues pertaining to ocean usage and sovereignty such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided definition and breadth of different maritime zones;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong>Territorial Sea:</strong></li></ol>



<p>It is a portion of the sea which is adjacent to the coast and over which the coastal states can exercise sovereignty subject to the right of foreign ships to innocent passage. Under UNCLOS III the territorial water limit was agreed to be 12 nautical miles measured from the baseline.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Exclusive Economic Zone:</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>It is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea extending up to 200 nautical miles seaward from the baseline. In this zone, the coastal states have exclusive rights and duties, to, amongst other things, explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living, nonliving, and natural resources within this area.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Continental Shelf:</strong></li></ol>



<p>It is that area of the coastal state which comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea up to a distance of 200-350 nautical miles from the baseline. However, it shall not exceed beyond that.</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided certain rights to Coastal states as well as other states:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong>Rights of Coastal States:</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>They have certain exclusive rights including the right of fishing, rights over sea bed resources, rights to enact laws and regulations relating to transport and navigation, and the right to hold states responsible for non-compliance, etc.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Right of other states:</strong></li></ol>



<p>The convention secures the “right of innocent passage” to other states through the territorial water of coastal states. Such a right implies that as long as a vessel has a purpose of traveling across the territorial sea, it amounts to innocent passage, which cannot be hindered by the coastal state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided for the establishment of International Seabed Authority;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>It has also established an inter-governmental body known as the International Seabed Authority to organize, regulate, and control activities that are mineral-related in the international sea-bed area beyond the limits of the continental shelf of coastal states.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>It provided conflict resolution methods;</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>For three decades, dispute settlement under this convention has flourished, in the form of negotiation, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, and formation of the commission on the continental shelf.</p>



<h4><strong>Protection of Marine Environment and Biodiversity</strong></h4>



<p>Oceans, despite being essential for survival, are subjected to a lot of degradation due to destructive human activities such as resource extraction, overfishing, pollution, etc. The United Nations under its various programs is working towards the protection of Marine Environment and Biodiversity:</p>



<p><strong>The United Nation Environmental Programme (UNEP)</strong> is trying to work out solutions and strategies which will diminish human impacts and promote good use of marine and coastal ecosystems:</p>



<ol><li>It is working to promote and restore coastal blue carbon ecosystems by advancing science-based management approaches, international cooperation, a regional and global assessment by using practical methods to conserve and restore this ecosystem.&nbsp;</li><li>It is also assisting nations to adopt equitable and effective uses of the marine environment while protecting areas by furnishing technical support and building a capacity for the management of these areas.&nbsp;</li><li>World’s coral reefs, which generate millions of dollars annually, are degrading at a high rate due to destructive fishing, unsustainable development, ocean acidification, etc. UNEP is trying to protect these reefs by working with different stakeholders and partners such as <strong>International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), Regional Seas Programme, Reef world, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Since the coming of the Regional Seas Programme, the United Nations has significantly been able to address the generation of the world&#8217;s oceans through a “shared seas” approach, which is to engage adjacent nations in extensive and particular actions to conserve their common marine environment.</li><li>UNEP is also hosting the <strong>Global Programme of Action (GPA)&nbsp;</strong> for the protection of the marine environment from land-based activities to deal with land-based pollution which contributes to nearly 80% of marine pollution. It emphasizes addressing three primary source categories that are, marine litter, nutrient management, and wastewater. <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/oceans-seas/what-we-do/addressing-land-based-pollution"></a>source: www.unenvironment.org</li></ol>



<h4><strong>International maritime organization (IMO)</strong></h4>



<p>It was established as a specialized agency for the advancement of international maritime law. Its main purpose is to create and maintain a broad regulatory framework for shipping and safety, legal matters, environmental concerns, technical co-operations, and efficiency of shipping.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Marine shipping and pollution:</strong> In order to reduce air pollution due to shipping, IMO has adopted different measures. These include;</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973</strong>, now known as MARPOL. It addresses pollution from ships caused due to noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, garbage, and oil. MARPOL has significantly been able to reduce pollution from international shipping. These measures have ensured that oil tankers are made and operated safely and in such a way so as to ensure very little oil is spilled in accidents.</li><li>With regard to chemicals, it has been instructed that the design of ships should be such as to reduce the risks to ships, their crew, and the environment. Moreover, it has been prohibited to discharge sewage into the sea.</li><li>It limits the use of main air pollutants contained in ships such as sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide. The emission of ozone-depleting substances has also been prohibited.</li><li>Additionally, a separate convention has been made known as the International Convention For The Prevention Of Pollution Of The Sea By Oil (oil pool).</li></ul>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Polar Code:</strong> It is foreseen that the polar maritime traffic is going to increase in the coming years. These regions are visited because of commercial imperatives and growing tourism, in the north and south respectively. However, this should not hamper the life of the sea and the sustainability of the environment of Polar Regions. Moreover, the protection of the environment and security of ships navigating in tough, remote, and exposed Polar Regions has always been a concern for IMO. There are different challenges to the ships operating, that are a shortage of communication systems, good charts, different navigational aids, and poor weather conditions.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ul><li>With the growing polar shipping, IMO has addressed International concern about the protection of the polar environment and the safety of seafarers and passengers by introducing new regulations that all ships operating in these waters must comply with.&nbsp;</li><li>International Code For Ships Operating In Polar Waters (polar code) is mandatory under both the International Convention For The Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLACE) and MARPOL. It sets out mandatory standards that cover the wide range of design and construction, equipment, operational and training concern, rescue, and the protection of the pristine environment and ecosystems of both the poles as well.&nbsp;</li><li>Each chapter contains different aims and functions that include watertight and weathertight integrity, ship structure, machinery installations, the safety of navigation, voyage planning, training, etc. on one hand and prevention of pollution due to oil, chemicals, sewage, and the discharge of garbage on the other and.</li></ul>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Piracy: </strong>An unauthorized act of violence committed by a private vessel in seas against another vessel with intent to loot or rob is called piracy. It is considered to be an international crime and pirates as enemies of every state. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/hqqKCm4TxULeffCw6"></a></li></ol>



<ul><li>At the beginning of the present century, the acts of piracy have increased particularly on the coasts of Somalia. At least, Eighty-four attacks and millions of dollars have been robbed, many have been killed, injured and hundreds of hostages were taken in a single year. To tackle this problem, representatives of Somalia urged the president of the Security Council for the safety of the shipping and navigation. Consequently, a resolution was adopted to condemn all acts of piracy in territorial waters and high seas in Somalia.&nbsp;</li><li>Also, IMO has developed certain regulations and guidance through the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) to secure and manage travel and trade across seas. Thus, it has addressed the issue of piracy and armed robbery against ships too.&nbsp;</li><li>Due to the above-mentioned situation in Somalia, IMO is trying to enhance maritime security in west and central Africa, with the region&#8217;s maritime agreements. Fortunately, ill effects of piracy have been mitigated over time because of the adoption of several anticipatory measures by IMO with the support of shipping industries. Its armed robbery and piracy module has information publicly available with the globally integrated shipping information system.</li><li>Further,&nbsp; the member states who seek to enlarge their national measures for the threat of piracy and different unlawful activities can get IMO’S assistance.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission</strong></h4>



<p>The United Nations educational, scientific, and cultural organizations&#8217; Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)&#8217; works to promote international cooperation and coordinates programs pertaining to marine research, services, hazard mitigation, observation systems, and effective management of the resources of coastal areas and oceans. This commission aims to foster management, administration, decision-making processes for sustainable development of the marine environment.</p>



<h4><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h4>



<p>The United Nations through the conventions and formation of IMO covers various aspects of the sea such as navigation, fishing, deep seabed mining, etc. It is accepted today worldwide that the convention of 1982 is a &#8216;constitution for the oceans&#8217;, within which every activity pertaining to seas must be done. As far as resource extraction and utilization of these oceans in its different aspects are concerned, the same should be carried out in a way so as to not abate the marine environment and biodiversity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;The U.S relations with Mexico could be regarded as indispensable because of the fact that the countries share land and maritime border in North America. Several treaties have been concluded between the two nations such as the Gadsden Purchase (an agreement between the U.S and Mexico, in which the U.S agreed to pay Mexico $10million for a 2, 09,670 square mile portion of Mexico) and the <strong>North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA)</strong> (an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico and U.S, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America). Both are members of the various international organizations including the organization of the American States and the United Nations.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that both countries have close diplomatic, economic, and socio-cultural relations, illegal immigration and illegal trade in drugs and firearms continue to be the causes of differences between the two countries.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin</strong></h4>



<p>The first border dispute between The United States and Mexico arose because of the reason for migration. In an effort to control the inflow of English-speaking settlers, Mexico banned immigration to Texas from The United States. With the independence of Texas from Mexico in 1845, it became a part of The United States as a slave state by the efforts of the then Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. As a result of the independence of Texas, Mexico ended up its diplomatic relations with the United States.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in a fix to make the Rio Grande River the border between The United States and Mexico which would make Texas part of The United States, the then U.S President James Polk in 1845 offered to purchase California and New Mexico from the Mexican government which in turn was refused. As a mark of retaliation to the refusal, Polk sent military forces to the Rio Grande, and a full-scale US invasion followed with the seizure of Mexico City.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="407" height="210" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kjB0Ve6XDR8UgMR7LaYNR7G4AXQJ7IJZPr5IX3JuGXmdI3Dr95NlbhX9Gp38gMNpeOCNeh9AlYQ6dRx4vFs2Ho9nmhksPURtbPXDQJY4e0-317kWRJrTNE-QbpXBd8R-NS4nkri_"></p>



<p>Thereafter, the peace treaty of <strong>Guadalupe</strong> <strong>Hidalgo</strong> was signed ending the Mexican-American war which obligated Mexico to relinquish present-day Arizona, California, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and Nevada. In return for the war-related damage to the Mexican land, $15 million in compensation was paid by The U.S. In addition to this, the peace treaty also provided for the protection of the property and civil rights of the roughly 80,000 Mexican nationals living in The U.S.</p>



<p>In 1853, the then U.S President Franklin Pierce planned to construct a railroad to the Pacific ocean for which he purchased 30,000 square miles of land along the Mesilla Valley which runs from California to El Paso for $10 million. The Gadsden Purchase marks the last adjustment to the border between Mexico and The United States and also the resolution for an indispensable border dispute between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;Cross Border Issues</strong></h4>



<p>The U.S- Mexican relations have usually remained friendly, nevertheless, periodic tensions have emerged over some major as well as minor issues including trade disputes, immigration, border security issues, drug trafficking, border environmental issues, and water resource issues respectively.</p>



<h4>Drug Trafficking&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Drug trafficking is a global illicit trade involving the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of substances that are subject to drug prohibition laws.</p>



<p>Mexico plays a major role in the US drug control policy as it is the primary source of and transit country for illicit drugs like heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine, fentanyl. Besides, Mexico is also a major transit country for cocaine produced in the Andean region of South America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fWZTs8sSSUU2-1TpfTHRNLiQgJ_ZIUUfln5lgpzVGnslhPx6BV8VKhXnQFaCy3AvoI5-J9Y2W2WcJXKDY7pTznmMPIzQTAxjeO8VI4n2ahrMpX3iAiQNc1YgwffUQkDrDuDvQ6j3" alt=""/></figure>



<p>According to the Drug Enforcement administration (it is an agency tasked with combating drug trafficking and distribution within the United States) 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican drug trafficking organisations which are involved in<strong> drug trafficking</strong>,<strong> money laundering</strong>, and other violent crime continue to pose a greatest criminal threat to the United States.</p>



<p>In 1969, an aggressive search and seizure counternarcotics operation was launched on the U.S Mexico border, by the then U.S President Richard Nixon while declaring “war on drugs”. The government of the United States deployed the agents for the purpose of inspecting all the persons and vehicles crossing into The United States through the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GNUFpZZZsUCtSY6OIrEx9IwZ6h9SzjE9E_oWL63fWjzN1cYNkWRNZt0c3ITEzNKDL3WnYFBw4wABrQSgQBQmB5LFJrfdzjHHrp43jDdPojPIYW-UC5HZxRdVJOoA-kbVsVG3qzbV" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The United States created the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA and there was some counternarcotics cooperation in the 1970s and 80s. However, the killing of one of its DEA agents in Mexico sparked outrage in The United States which led them to pursue the <strong>unilateral strategy to fight the war on drugs</strong>.</p>



<p>Data on drug seizures at the U.S. border indicate an alarming volume of trafficking taking place in recent years. Since 2009, heroin seizures at the southwestern border have almost tripled, while meth seizures quintupled. However, cocaine and marijuana remain two of the most commonly seized drugs along the southern borders, equating to millions of pounds seized by the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>



<p>Since 2012, the number of traffickers apprehended at U.S. borders has steadily increased from 364,768 to nearly 500,000 in 2014. From 2012 to 2015 the U.S. Border Patrol has seized more than:</p>



<p><strong>8.2 million lbs. of marijuana</strong></p>



<p><strong>32,600 lbs. of cocaine</strong></p>



<p><strong>34,000 ounces of heroin</strong></p>



<p><strong>17,600 lbs. of methamphetamine</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite the high volume of search &amp; seizure programs that have effectively stopped millions of pounds of illicit drugs from entering the&nbsp; U.S,&nbsp; drugs are still finding their way across and have a profound impact in many states along southern and coastal borders.</p>



<h4><strong>Unauthorised Immigration&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Unauthorized immigration refers to the migration of people into a country in violation of the immigration laws of that country or the continued residence of people without the legal right to live in that country.</p>



<p>Unauthorized immigration has always been a subject of greater concern between The US and Mexico with much emphasis on how to prevent unauthorized migration and address the large population of illegal migrants living in the United States. Mexico being the largest source of unauthorized migrants in The United States, the U.S migration policies including stepped-up border and interior enforcement have primarily affected Mexicans as more Mexicans have been leaving the United States than arriving. However, the Mexicans living in the United States, including those who are unauthorized remain the top priority of the Mexican government.&nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="497" height="289" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R1S_Xr_TH953RI-AZtFngmkrIRYvb5xzwp3IQsr2DaTOI-DGjyHUUGdxGQl6dZZwXTEB2L94uXW2iHu6oeLxv2cKTfG8MWpbIrYs751Aqu4KhGSVH6s4h2eQO19q-xNJyjI8eY8l"></p>



<p><em>Undocumented Guatemalans carry their belongings after crossing the Guatemala-Mexico border</em></p>



<p>While the concern of the US government over unauthorized immigration was on peak in the 1990s, it came up with the strategy for tracking down the unauthorized immigrants living in the&nbsp; United States including the enforcement plan increasing border security and granting power to local law enforcement in the Border States to uphold immigration laws.</p>



<p>Since the mid-2000, successive Mexican governments have supported efforts to enact the Immigration reform in the United States, while being careful not to appear infringing upon US authority to make and enforce immigration laws. Mexico has made efforts to combat transmigration by unauthorized migrants and worked with US law enforcement to combat alien smuggling and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>NAFTA and USMCA</strong></h4>



<p>In 1980, the then US President Ronal Reagan put forth the idea of the <strong>North American Free Trade </strong>Zone as a part of his presidential campaign. After signing the Canada-United States free trade agreement in 1988, the governments of the US, Mexico, and Canada agreed to negotiate on what became NAFTA but even after ratification of the agreement by their respective capitals, NAFTA faced significant opposition in both US and Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQ-1CaWpYLLpg4JHSeR1uYIdH0bAX3idFKX081cB76qDQVhHMsMMZqjKt_cpA8VAS-ZCvFQU0sAmREweX5zhl1EcfAfylM90o0MMH-RAW3ohUS7fTmRYAoibo47Yi8AkedV-O2Br" alt="" width="595" height="429"/></figure>



<p>Eventually, all the three countries ratified NAFTA in 1993, and finally, it came into force a year later, after the addition of the two side agreements to it, The North American Agreement on Labor cooperation NAALC (it is the side agreement to NAFTA under which each of the three countries that are parties to NAFTA agreed to enforce their own labor standards and to strive to improve labor standards in their country) and The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation NAAEC (it is an environmental agreement between the US Canada and Mexico as a&nbsp; side treaty to NAFTA which sets out objectives concerning the conservation and the protection of the environment as well as concrete measures to further cooperation on the matters between the three countries).</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of NAFTA:</strong></h4>



<p>•<strong> NAFTA</strong> <strong>eliminated barriers to trade and investment</strong> between the US, Canada, and Mexico.</p>



<p>• It <strong>eliminated most tariffs</strong> with the major focus on liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobile manufacturing.</p>



<p>• The agreement also sought to protect intellectual property, establish dispute resolution mechanisms and through side agreements, implement labor and environmental safeguards.</p>



<p>• NAFTA fundamentally<strong> proved beneficial to North American economies </strong>and the average citizens but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.</p>



<p>On the other hand, critics of the agreement argue that it was to be blamed for job losses, wage stagnation driven by low wage competition, and a widening trade deficit.</p>



<p>After US President Donald Trump took office in 2017, all the three signatories a year later reached an agreement to modernize the 25-year-old NAFTA with the <strong>United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)</strong> and all the three countries had ratified it in 2020. The USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020, replacing NAFTA. The new United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and strong economic growth.</p>



<h4>Cross Border Environmental Issues&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Environmental health and environmental quality issues along the US-Mexico border have always been a concern for several years. Transboundary and shared resources and conflict include the flow of raw sewage and industrial wastewater into the United States from Mexico which has caused health and environmental problems in the border region.</p>



<p>Wastewater collection and treatment system capacity has not kept pace with rapid population growth in the border region. Also, the aging of existing wastewater infrastructure has resulted in increased maintenance issues such as pipeline ruptures. To address border sanitation issues, International Boundary and Water Commission <strong>(IBWC)</strong>, The US Environmental Protection Agency <strong>(EPA)</strong>, and the North American Development Bank<strong> (NADB)</strong> have been engaged to construct wastewater infrastructure on both sides of the border.</p>



<h4><strong>Recent Development and Crisis</strong></h4>



<p>Since the beginning of Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign, U.S-Mexico relations have been in crisis. The bilateral relationships between the two countries have been seriously affected by Trump’s criticism of Mexico and its people, his threats to deport millions of undocumented Mexicans, his desire to build what he calls a <strong>“beautiful wall”</strong> on the southern border, and his express intention to abandon NAFTA. For Mexico officials and intellectuals, the current state of affairs has reached the lowest point in the two countries&#8217; relationship over the last 25 years.</p>



<p><strong>President Trump refocused the Merida initiative</strong> through executive orders on combating transnational criminal organizations and enhancing border security. Though Trump has praised Mexico’s enhanced efforts to reduce migration flows but criticized Mexico’s anti-drug performance. On the proposal of the Mexican government in 2019, a high-level security working group, with a view to combating organized crime and cross-border crime, was agreed to be created by the U.S government which includes the Merida initiative as one aspect of bilateral efforts.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">&nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="446" height="255" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UGZoOgorhfNXsWf39fCBNdvXsxhU-ihZjcthXZtUchl4zENe6dIs115Q8--BEfVhmZNjOVPLS5gotxrsHxZafzAwnBImoMtnIj5p0f6FwASBZVcGKenKU96ViWXf8Brkt5kbnJ-J"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trump&#8217;s         <em>Border Wall</em></p>



<p>Throughout Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, he called for the construction of a bigger, more impenetrable border wall with a view to preventing illegal immigration from Mexico along the U.S-Mexico border. In furtherance of this proposal, The Trump administration two years later announced new rules to deny asylum to anyone crossing the United States illegally. However, Mexico has substantially opposed the construction of the border wall as well as the Trump administration&#8217;s immigration policy for the reason that Mexico places high importance on immigration, not only because millions of co-nationals live in the U.S but also because they send millions of dollars to the country.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SeSq-AGPSV8eXwvB4bGAqsPTzj7oaHOyO8QjusUDyvyutk118CrOh2fk0Zex6RsR9iSqxMwGAXOA3C7g_1Z-i-I_sg7T2nApTjytvkZiQMC59X4fznIZ6C6fGgzWuYndV83x44V-" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>For the first time over the last 25 years, the U.S-Mexico relations have withered away. The structural system that has prevailed for more than two decades is now under considerable threat. Although USMCA succeeded in the 25 years old NAFTA its future at present remains unpredictable. The nature of the bilateral relationship is likely to change substantially if the U.S implements its immigration reform which will have an enduring impact on the economies of both countries.</p>



<p>The U.S government’s immigration reforms and the modification in NAFTA have adversely affected Mexican nationalism and the perception of the U.S. Thus, the consequence of Trump’s campaign and his presidency has lead to the collapse of the bilateral relations between the two countries on one hand and strengthened the unity of Mexico’s citizens against the US Foreign policy on the other hand.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Data privacy is of greater importance in a world with ever-growing mountains of big data. During the earlier times, the consumers used to share their personal information or data via the offline platform where the chances of data privacy risks were minimal, however, with the growing technology, the consumers in this digital age share their vital information on the online platform, be it on social media sites, E-commerce sites and other Apps to perform certain kind of actions.</p>



<p>The concept of data privacy in this modern era is usually applied to critical personal information also known as Personally Identifiable Information. Such information is used for the purpose of identification of any person like the driver’s license number, bank account number, passport number, etc. and Personal Health Information in a medical record used for the identification of any person which was disclosed, created, or used in the course of providing a health care service. Of late with such a sensitive and personal data record, it becomes challenging when it attempts to use the data while protecting an individual’s personally identifiable information and privacy preferences.</p>



<h4><strong>Digitization of Services</strong></h4>



<p>While the consumers are sharing personal data on online platforms that collect growing amounts of information on the one hand, they have started visualising the danger in such data collection on the other hand. Data privacy has become more important in this digitalized world and those platforms collecting the vital information of an individual should be highly concerned with their data privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy </strong></h4>



<p>Primarily, privacy is the Right of a citizen of being free from public scrutiny or from having one’s personal information shared. Data Privacy is the right of the citizen to have control over how one’s personal information is collected and used. It deals with the practices which ensure that the data so shared by any person must be used for its intended purpose.</p>



<p>Most of the time, Data privacy is confused with Data security and is used interchangeably however, data privacy and data security are, by no means, the same terms.</p>



<p>Like, if you are using a Google Gmail account, your password would be a method of data security, while the way Google uses your data to administer your account would be data privacy.</p>



<p>Data security is a prerequisite to Data privacy therefore it is possible to have healthy security stand without addressing data privacy. However, it is not possible to ensure Data privacy without a solid security stand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9_wUOi_faXhF9sufm5ODOzjOZBL78uxrSF56tH3SnvEo1NNdhQSRxxBfZ0J7AXe6a36ita6XiIk0zWP_Aq8mqZHhDWwKjpJYaVX7CZuozQ0f4mX7qtST0bbCSJF1V-S8i-RKP5J1" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy and Data Security</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2KHHHno84GIoPLml6egdIRtC3qUwPZSL9bAKfZaUI1VWU8IUNmof27Admq_NK2yVjxZIS5V95hg2b2ptpcoDxvZ5M5ZubUSfsGNUFk6iWz8uzI2TAcx6drqZDb3ER5cDDYjETP8g" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy a Real Major Concern</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In this age of digitization, personal data influences a lot of our activities. It affects nearly everything including from what content or messages we see on the internet to so many decisions made whether it’s about a job, a license, or a loan and thereby sway almost every aspect of our lives. Since the autonomy and control over our lives are one of the hallmarks of freedom which would be rendered useless if the important decisions about our lives are being made without our participation which might turn out to be one of the reasons which give rise to data privacy concerns.</p>



<p><strong>Various types of personal information that often come under privacy concerns may be listed as follows;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Financial Information</strong></h4>



<p>Any financial information which is shared online or offline is sensitive as it can be used maliciously by someone to commit fraud. In 2019, First American Financial Corp. had 885 million records exposed online including bank transactions, social security numbers, and more.</p>



<p>Data about an individual’s financial transaction like the positions held in stocks and funds, outstanding debts, amount of assets, and purchases is usually sensitive. The person concerned could be the victim of identity theft or fraud if the criminals get access to such information. Similarly, data about a person’s purchases can reveal a great lot of information like the medications used, places visited, contacts, activities, or habits. This data may also be used by the corporations for the purpose of targeting the individual concerned with marketing customized towards the personal preferences of those individuals which the person concerned may or may not approve.</p>



<h4><strong>Internet Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In the modern era, where most of the information is shared online be it on social networking sites or other Apps, people experience growing concern about privacy challenges. With the use of various search engines and data mining, it has become possible to collect and combine information from a wide variety of sources very easily.</p>



<p><strong>For instance the Aadhaar Data Breach:</strong></p>



<p> In 2018 there was a massive breach In India allowing access to private information of Aadhaar holders, exposing their names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and their bank details along with the photographs, thumbprints, retina scans, and other identifying details of nearly 1.1 billion citizens.</p>



<p>One of the most worrisome issues of today’s world is the ability of a third person to control the information one reveals over the internet and who can access that information, whether Email can be read or stored by third parties without consent if websites one visited can collect, store and possibly share the personal information, whether third parties can track the websites that someone visited, etc.</p>



<h4><strong>Locational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Locational Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Locational data is the most sensitive data being collected by tracking capabilities of mobile devices which have the potential to strip away locational privacy from individuals, making it possible to intrude into the lives of others by consulting location databases. In 2017, McDelivery leak disclosed home addresses and even exact coordinates of 2.2 million users.</p>



<p>By tracking the locational information, potentially sensitive professional and personal information like the presence of a person at an abortion clinic, an AIDS counselor, attendance of a religious place, etc. could be exposed which unfortunately poses a threat to locational privacy.</p>



<h4><strong>Medical Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Medical Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Confidentiality and privacy are essential to all trusting relationships such as that between a doctor and a patient. Patient confidentiality and protection of privacy have always been the basis of the doctor-patient relationship. People usually do not prefer that their medical records be revealed to others because of the fact that it may affect their medical insurance, employment, and that it may bring embarrassment upon them.</p>



<p>Medical privacy may include information relating to physical and sexual activity, genetic data, bodily functions, psychological problems, etc.</p>



<p>In 2018, the healthcare sector saw 15 million patient records compromised in 503 breaches, three times the amount seen in the previous year, according to the Protenus Breach Barometer.</p>



<h4><strong>Educational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In earlier days, photocopies, textbooks, and filmstrips supplied the entire educational content to the students. However, with the advancement of technology and telecommunications, the education system has greatly changed and a new system including personalized content, virtual forms of interaction, and interactive technologies has been introduced.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though the adopters of these technologies have proved their worth by transforming the educational process however, the use of high-tech education systems has proved to be a double-edged sword. Using information systems like Arcon and portal, tools like Microsoft Office and Google, educational Apps like Edmodo and Dropbox exposes the student data to a number of security and privacy risks. Technologies like information sharing, telecommunication innovations, and web-hosting also expose the information related to students to risks during their use.</p>



<p>In 2020, cybersecurity firm Cybele discovered at least 530,000 zoom accounts listed for sale on a dark web hacker forum for $0.0020 cents.</p>



<p>The data relating to students so exposed or improperly disclosed can cause significant harm to students where students may indulge in violating each other’s privacy like online gossip, cyberbullying, etc. Besides, it can also result in a misunderstanding between schools and parents, alumni, applicants, and others.</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy Risks</strong></h4>



<p>As personal information has become the subject of a digitized world, the risks of cyber attacks have increasingly posed a threat to data privacy. The data privacy risks have the tendency to cause a data breach when a cybercriminal infiltrates a data source and extracts confidential information. While most data breaches occur due to hacking or malware attacks other methods include accidental data sharing, employee data theft, internet fraud, etc.</p>



<p><strong>The most common data breaches occur due to the following risks:</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Accidental Data Sharing&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Personal data is usually exposed by cybercriminals however, sometimes the company’s own employees accidentally share and misplace consumer’s sensitive data resulting in the data breach. For example in 2018, hundreds of Australian’s personally identifiable information and health information we&#8217;re exposed to the public after an employee accidentally shared some sensitive data with an organizational outsider.</p>



<p><strong>• Employee Data Theft</strong></p>



<p>The data theft by a departing employee is a bigger threat than that of a hacker. It occurs most frequently when an employee leaves or resigns from an organization to work for a competitor or to set up their own rival company. For instance, Levandowski in 2019, stole diagrams and drawings related to simulations, radar technology, and Light Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), source code snippets, PDFs marked as confidential, Videos of test drives, and Marketing information from Google and provided it to Uber.</p>



<p><strong>Most commonly the data theft includes stealing of customer information, financial records, Email list, process document, employees records etc.</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;• Ransomware</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ransomware attacks have been becoming grave as the years pass by. Ransomware is the form of malware that encrypts the victim’s file. The attacker then demands the victim to restore access to data upon payment. In order to retrieve the basic data hostage and to restore affected data, most of the organizations agree to pay the ransom to the attackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;As witnessed in 2019, the ransomware attacks have vastly affected sectors like health care, manufacturing, finance, etc. As a response to this many companies has put forth ransomware prevention as a priority in 2020.</p>



<p><strong>• Bad Password Hygiene&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Account passwords should be such so that they are difficult to guess and harder to crack. An overwhelming number of passwords may lead to poor password hygiene when there is no technology in place to help.</p>



<p>Reusing and sharing of passwords has remained a common practice in most businesses among the employees resulting in countless data breaches and individual account takeovers.</p>



<p>The incidents leading to poor password hygiene may include selecting passwords that are obvious, selecting the same password for each account, temptation to share passwords with others for convenience, and writing down the passwords for easy recall, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Phishing Emails&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A phishing attack is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon to lure the victim with an attempt to obtain sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It manipulates the victims into performing certain actions like clicking on a malicious link or willfully disclosing the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>• Internet Frauds&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The main aim of internet fraud usually is to deceive the victim or to otherwise take advantage of them by stealing the information. such information can be used for financial gain by making fraudulent transactions, draining bank accounts, etc. which may result in significant reputational repercussions and increase the risk of class action lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>one of the oldest internet fraud examples is Nigerian Email scams. Someone from a country (often Nigeria, but not always) contacts you via email in broken English. They explain that a rich person they know has died and the money has nowhere to go; if you can help them get the funds out of the country, they’ll give you some as a reward</p>



<p>The most prominent internet frauds are online shopping frauds, email scams, identity theft, tax scams, lottery frauds, matrimonial frauds, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Bribery&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bribery mostly results in serious data security concern to those companies whose data and intellectual property is incredible of high value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though bribery not being the most convenient way to perpetuate data, however, the officials of a company can be bribed into revealing the company’s confidential data. In 2018, the employees of Amazon were accused of participating in a bribery scheme that compromises customer data, and a year later it was discovered that AT&amp;T employees received bribes to plant malware on the company’s network.</p>



<h4><strong>How important is Data Privacy?</strong></h4>



<p>Data is an incredibly important part of a company’s asset, collecting and sharing of data can be a big business in today’s digital world but for a business to safely and successfully take advantage of data they are collecting, they need to have safeguards in place to ensure that data is under tight lock and consumers are not subject to uninvited surveillance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this age of digital economy, true company value lies in the collected customer data which is an asset, worthy of being protected. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data created and stored continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Any information stored digitally needs to be properly protected right from financial information and payment details to contact information. Data protection is not only a legal necessity but crucial for protecting and maintaining the business also.</p>



<p>Data privacy importance lies in the fact that individuals are able to maintain their autonomy and individuality over how their personal information moves into the economy and society. The right to privacy is the fundamental right of an individual so he is at liberty to protect his data and regulate its use.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Data Privacy Tips</strong>:</p>



<p>While the new decade promised an unexplored revolution in the field of Information Technology which has blurred the lines between the real world and the virtual one, it becomes vital for people to be more concerned about their privacy. </p>



<p><strong>Some tips that may help to create a friendly environment for commerce, learning, and communication are listed as follows;</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Use a Safe Search Engine</strong></p>



<p>It’s possible that sometimes a person can be scammed easily by fake engines leading one to fake pages that look like true intended sites. So if one intends to search an online retailer, instead of searching him through the search engine, one should directly visit the secure https:// page or use the App launched by such retailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>•<strong> Use Two Factor Authentication</strong></p>



<p>Two-factor authentication is a higher level of security process than the single factor authentication method in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. It adds an extra layer of security by making the logins extra secure and difficult for hackers to hack sensitive information. It confirms the identity of a person by using two factors one is the password and the other is the security token or a biometric factor, such as fingerprint or facial scan.</p>



<p>• <strong>Anti-Virus Software&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The updated Anti-virus software program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware can better protect sensitive data from being hacked. It not only safeguards from malicious files and viruses but also helps to protect personal information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Digital Vault</strong></p>



<p>Digital Vault is an online vault that protects the information inside it by securing the data from all major risks over the network. It provides great help in securing all the necessary information like a credit card, social security, driving license, passport numbers, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Safe Wi-Fi Environment</strong></p>



<p>The public wifi is inherently less secure than that of the personal one because the number of connections is not known. One should always avail of the safest security protocol to avoid data theft or privacy issues while on public wifi. For this purpose, one can use a secure VPN that hides the IP address and encrypts the information over the web.</p>



<p>• <strong>Limited Information on Social Media</strong></p>



<p>For the protection of personal data, one should avoid personally identifiable information to be shared on social networking sites which could be later used as answers to security questions. The social media privacy settings should be updated to limit the information collected by different sites and who can see the information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Strong Passwords</strong></p>



<p>One should always create strong passwords by making use of capital letters, lowercase, numbers, special characters and change them often. The stronger the password, the more difficult a threat will be.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>How much are&nbsp;the Countries Concerned?</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1IP5XARUhpT-d-CjaXxDGVOB3hs1R1cuuMRuKqU7L_SCvYVdZ0daDj1IRFkOUcmAeUTB-lu3qY7B0MkFErI5Q17-pVrXWMLy9CMMoAky0bgpDf7FgM_VnstJgF7qFdFYI8umBXM6" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In order to address the data privacy issues like data theft, phishing email attacks, ransomware attacks, etc. almost every country around the Globe has enacted data privacy legislation under their municipal laws. These laws govern the rules and regulations for the collection, storage, and use of collected data in a legitimate manner. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the privacy laws around the world are as follows:</strong></p>



<p>1. <strong>CCPA</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act / USA&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Officially in effect on January 1st, 2020, this legislation demands the companies to inform the user of data processing, take extra measures to protect user information, and allow users a say in what data is collected and how it is shared.</p>



<p><strong>2. CALOPPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The California Online Privacy Protection Act/ USA.</strong></p>



<p>This Act requires commercial websites to post privacy policies detailing data collection and use on their website.</p>



<p><strong>3. CFAA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act/US.</strong></p>



<p>The law prohibits accessing the computer without authorization or excess of authorization in order to reduce the instances of malicious hacking.</p>



<p><strong>4. PIPEDA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act/Canada.</strong></p>



<p>This Act mandates that businesses using data for, or in the course of, commercial activities, must disclose the purpose of that data collection to the owners of that data, and obtain consent to proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. LGPD</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lei Geral de Protèçao de dados Pessoais/ Brazil.</strong></p>



<p>LGPD is landmark legislation outlining data processing standards, including the ten legal bases on which the data can be processed. While the law was modeled after the EU GDPR it is notably less strict.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>PDP</strong></p>



<p><strong>National Directorate of Personal Data Protection/ Argentina.</strong></p>



<p>This law replaced Argentina’s Personal Data Protection Law and it gave users for the first time in Argentina the right to request, the deletion, and transfer of data.</p>



<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>GDPR</strong></p>



<p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation/EU.</strong></p>



<p>It sets the strictest and most far-reaching standards for the handling of user data. It is based on the principles of consent, transparency, protection, and user control, and threatens fines as high as 4% of a company&#8217;s annual revenue.</p>



<p><strong>8. e-Privacy</strong></p>



<p><strong>e-Privacy Directive and Regulation/ EU.</strong></p>



<p>The ePrivacy Directive is often referred to as cookie law due to its requirement that websites obtain user consent to non-essential cookies before launching those cookies.</p>

<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Data privacy has generated the attention of the individuals, sharing sensitive personally identifiable information due to the privacy breach incidents which are increasing as the technology is evolving. The collection, transfer, and dissemination of information which usually takes place via the internet, get exposed to a number of risks. For this reason, it generates the attention of the public, academics, government, and the business class which is valuable for the reason that would encourage concern to be shown to the past and future of privacy protection.</p>



<p>Privacy being a fundamental right is an element of a healthy democratic society and a social property which relates to power, culture, values, social standing, liberty, and dignity among other things.</p>



<p>In order to take the account of data privacy risks, though much legislation has been enacted to address these issues, however, there are still incidents of data privacy intrusions for which the countries need to come up with the effective implementation of those legislations. Since there is an alarming rise of data privacy risks leading to data thefts and data breaches, the Legislations alone won’t count so, it’s high time that the information technology industry and government come together to lay down and regulate the effective means and norms to curb the menace of intrusion of privacy.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Water is an essential natural resource. It is a basic requirement for the survival of living organisms. Clean drinking water is important for a healthy life. Even though more than 70% of Earth is covered by water, less than three percent of the water covering the earth is freshwater, and the bulk of that is not even accessible as that is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Therefore, very less (approximately 1%) is available for our day to day consumption and fulfilling our various needs. Thus, while we may think that water will always be available in abundance, it is not so, instead, scarcity of <strong>fresh water is one of the</strong> <strong>major environmental problems of the 21st century.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Water Scarcity: A Global Crisis</strong></h4>



<p>Nothing is more essential than water on earth. Yet, according to an estimation of the World Health Organisation, it has been seen that almost 700 million people, i.e. 1 in 10 people, lack access to water, and almost 4 billion people experience water scarcity at least one month in a year. Though water scarcity is a global issue, it has been found that it affected developing and underdeveloped countries the most. In some countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, less than half the population has access to clean water. The condition is so grave that the ‘World Economic Forum’ has ranked the water crisis as the top biggest risk to humanity and human economics. Even the United Nations has said that two-thirds of the human population is going to face water scarcity by 2025.</p>



<p>Water scarcity can range from a challenging but manageable water shortage to a full-blown water crisis. Further, when it comes to the <strong>classification of water scarcity</strong>, for better understanding, it is classified into physical water scarcity and economic water scarcity.</p>



<p><strong>Physical water scarcity </strong>or <strong>Absolute water scarcity refers to </strong>a situation when there isn&#8217;t an adequate amount of water available to meet the demand, i.e. demand outpaces the limited water resources available in a given region.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Economic water scarcity refers to</strong> water scarcity which occurs primarily because of poor infrastructure or mismanagement of water resources. It may also arise due to unregulated use of water in agriculture or industry, at the expense of the general population.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WaLZbIZhwPSmR8OPz5EEEFEo1_06bATZF6eHZoprutIOdvxjaLdvvNXrpW23zpJqeM3ItliLPZoFNsu6eP1yqFDgKqeuGGXeZbA6Eh7G7kXtc8GVg-0mifDPtPvB3vGYgYkZbBH_" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>What Causes Water Scarcity? </strong></h4>



<p>The rate at which we are moving towards a global water crisis which seems to be irrevocable is alarming. Though we rely on water for our survival, we as humans are the biggest contributors to the present crisis. Water systems are increasingly stressed, and some rivers, lakes, and other water bodies are drying up due to a variety of causes, many of which are a result of human activity. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the chief causes of water scarcity in the world are discussed below:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Pollution:</strong> UN World Water Assessment Program estimated in 2003 that every day, 2 million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged into the world’s water, the equivalent of the weight of the entire human population. The portable water which is already present at very low levels is further made unfit for consumption by pollution. Almost 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to drink water that is contaminated from feces as per the UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. Further, hundreds of millions of people worldwide are strained to consume water that is dangerously, chemically polluted as well. <strong>The chart below identifies some of the chief sources of water contamination.</strong></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZALKE_O29xkZHXqLbANPiC_VhRRPAww4dipbjAjenScRZrck9e_5ZMhIVIC74y92-tz2Qb6V1ZErOv-pnFaBMDh4zywX8JgDLN12dg8n4W3f-rOlExml8OeVq125Vzh5uiIOVtvz" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Causes of Water Pollution</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Climate Change: </strong>Over the last 25 years, floods, droughts, and other weather-related events have caused more than 90% of major weather-related disasters. Such events are further expected to increase in severity and frequency with climate change. InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that climate change over the 21st century may reduce the renewable water resources significantly in many dry sub-tropical regions. If the existing climate change pattern continues, UN WWDR 2009 (World Water Development Report) reveals, by 2030 water scarcity in some arid and semi-arid places will displace around 700 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Population Growth: </strong>It has been witnessed that population growth has doubled up in almost the last 50 yrs. Because of such fast growth, there has been an increase in demand for water consumption. This rapid growth with industrialization over years has adversely affected the water ecosystem. As the global water supply remains fixed and consumption increases it ultimately leads to water shortage.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qyKJRrl4m2LACM4RR3Su_IRaRt7uwe3hfivBzBrfGHhsGynZECrwiGLLoHkDg4uHaSMFHGUQ8en6WNiy6e3kBwfpWaohd_5NZMM7iz1BHPvh1zaNnhzLnCD9mAFel2YZuu4Qx6bi" alt=""/></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Wastage of Water: </strong>It has been on record that there is excessive use of water which leads to its wastage.<strong> </strong>In a mapped study done by NASA, it was revealed that 21 of the world’s major 37 water sources are distressed, mostly because of overuse from human consumption. The amount of wastewater produced annually is approximately 6 times more water than exists in all rivers of the world, i.e., about 1500 km³. People who have unlimited access to water use it indiscriminately without even thinking about those who are deprived of such a blessing.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Uneven Distribution of Water Resources:&nbsp;</strong>Due to the uneven distribution of potable water across the globe many areas face shortage of water. Most of North America, Europe, Brazil, and even parts of Africa, currently have more than enough renewable freshwater. Other regions are desperately under-served, like North Africa, Middle East, India, Mexico, large portions of South America and many Islands.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6eNMRTQXXUdzn-A_xHc5g0Vz6LWH8pPaC-XN6-OYUUN44KxLzqiU_9SyLPeJnHTOOUla2cdOCxxTcfcWR8N1EqgkHkBvUPnyOieijDkdUqPVFoSyTiyMYqPD-V4PM9g0XnJcHZ9X" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>What are the Consequences of Water Scarcity? </strong></h4>



<p>Indiscriminate use of water and reckless behavior of human beings has resulted in acute water scarcity which has caused calamitous effects. It has been estimated that by 2040, not much water would be available to meet the demand of humans as well as ecosystems.</p>



<p><strong>Some effects of water scarcity are listed below:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Food Shortage: </strong>Shortage of water has a grave impact on agricultural production. Agricultural production being a basic necessity that requires almost 70% of water, suffers gravely due to the shortage of water. With the increase in population and scarcity of water, it gets difficult to meet food demands, crop yield gets low. This can give rise to starvation and also leads to higher food costs.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GFVCEo1pSpZKbN453XPoN-3QuT34-XTQ-mfbhfseX5KvJsEmQDlgCbQDQyFnJ6eJIHvvD8efvCa25pL-7OKoNViD3VDIbGrJcpG-bD5aC_BMvdbtZ_-D8FgvVH7_mALKO7_Z_Ynn" alt="" width="657" height="475"/></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Health and Wellbeing:</strong> The scarcity of water affects healthy hygiene and proper sanitation which gives rise to numerous health-related and other problems. UNICEF in 2019 reported,&nbsp; 2 out of 5 people worldwide do not have a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home, and half of the global population lack safely managed sanitation services. Further,&nbsp; people living in areas with contaminated water are more likely to be infected by deadly water-borne diseases such as cholera, hepatitis, diarrhea, etc., with <strong>almost 1 million people dying every year from water</strong>, sanitation, and hygiene-related diseases. Also, every 2 minutes a child dies from a water-borne disease with diarrhea being one of the top causes, contributing an estimate of around 1.5 million deaths every year.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Threatened Ecosystem: </strong>Water scarcity has directly affected flora and fauna across the Globe, especially the disappearing of wetlands and damaging ecosystems. According to research by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), about half of the world’s wetlands have been destroyed since 1900. Due to scarcity of water, the ecosystem has imbalanced which resulted in the shrinking of sea bodies, in many areas seas have disappeared and left out is polluted land. &nbsp;Also, UNESCO reported in 2017 that 80% of wastewater flows back to the ecosystems without being treated or reused. Thus, the biological health keeps on deteriorating with the native plant and animal species becoming extinct.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Economic Slowdown:</strong> Shortage of water slows down economic activities. As suggested by a report of Water.Org, an estimated $260 billion is lost annually due to a lack of basic water and sanitation. Lack of freshwater, which is of primary use in agricultural and industrial activities, results in decreased outputs and increased prices, which in turn results in poverty and hence, a negative impact on the economy.</li><li><strong>Impact on Women and Children:</strong> Across the Globe women and children are worst hit by water scarcity. Mostly it has been seen that they bear the primary responsibility for collecting water and according to Water.Org, they spend a collective of 200 million hours a day collecting water. While women, like those in Sub-Saharan Africa, are responsible for collecting more than 70% of water, face negative impacts on their health, education, and safety, children also miss their schools because they have to spend hours collecting water. Likewise, poor sanitation keeps kids, especially girls, from being able to go to school. In many countries when girls reach the age of puberty and start menstruating they leave school, as there is a lack of water in restrooms and they have no other facilities to redress their needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increased Global Conflict:</strong> The increasing scarcity of water in the world has become a major cause of conflict. The World Economic Forum listed the water crisis at number four among the top ten risks faced by the world for 8 consecutive years. It can be weaponized and used to destroy or redirect access to water by countries to meet their objectives by targeting infrastructure and supplies. As per the Pacific Institute&#8217;s Water Conflict Chronology, out of 926 conflicts that have occurred in the past decade, 466 were related to water. The main water-related reasons that lead to conflict include; dependency on one major water source, disputes over dams, reservoirs, and other large scale projects. In fact, a new study by NASA interpreted that World War III is going to be fought over the scarcity of water if things don’t change soon.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Water Scarcity: Management</strong></h4>



<p>The urgent crisis that is unfolding before the world in the form of water scarcity requires an equally urgent response. Different international actors such as the UN and its agencies have been working tirelessly to ensure that the basic need of life, i.e., water is made available to all. Accordingly, the United Nations under its Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) calls for clean water and sanitation for all people.<strong> It aims to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” at least by 2030. </strong>Management of the crisis, however, becomes more important in areas that are most water-stressed, such as the <strong>Middle East</strong>, <strong>North Africa</strong>, and <strong>Asia</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>Middle East </strong>and<strong> North Africa </strong>(<strong>MENA</strong>) is the world&#8217;s most water-scarce region with total water productivity being only about half the world’s average. This region is the home to the top 10 worst-hit countries by water scarcity (Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iran, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E.).&nbsp; The situation there is worsening due to the impacts of conflict, climate change, and economic downturn. The World Bank has estimated that this region has the greatest expected economic losses from climate-related water scarcity, approximately up to 14% of GDP by 2050. The water crisis threatens the region’s stability as well as its human development and sustainable growth. Flood and drought risks are increasing and are likely to harm the poor disproportionately. However, the region is gearing up to deal with the challenge on several fronts. Some countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Palestine have approved national water resources plans. Other countries have developed frameworks that contain elements of policy, in the form of strategy or master plans. The region, being mostly dependent on transboundary water resources, is beginning to recognize the importance of an integrated approach to water management. <strong>The Gulf Cooperation Council countries ( Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., etc.) collect and treat almost 84% of the wastewater generated there</strong>. Some huge projects are also being developed to cope with water stress, for example,<strong> Qatar</strong> has started its “Water Security Mega Reservoirs Project” to store portable water as per the expected consumption rates in 2036; <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> launched the “Qatrah (water droplet in Arabic) Program” which sets to conserve water and reduce water usage by approximately 40-50% within the next decade.</p>



<h4><strong>What’s the situation in Asia?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Asia</strong> which is currently home to 4.5 billion people uses around 65% of the world’s water supply. Around 30% of the Asian population is already facing water scarcity. As a result of population growth, industrial development, and urbanization, the water crisis has become particularly acute. Many river basins already are unable to fulfill the demand for water that they face. According to the research of the International Institute for Applied System Analysis’ (IIASA) Water Program, by 2050, the water scarcity will further increase in almost 70 to 80% of the Asian regions. The problem in the region, however, has not been so much because of a shortage of water, as it has been because of poor management of the water resources and infrastructure. Nevertheless, in recent years, the countries have realized the gravity of the situation and have started taking some stern measures to deal with the crisis. Some of the worst affected countries in the regions, such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, China, Singapore, etc. have taken the lead in handling the situation through making new laws, designing new projects, and adopting new methods. <strong>Indian Government in 2019 set up a new ministry, the ‘Jal Shakti Ministry’, to prioritize the provision of clean drinking water for all</strong>, Pakistan drafted a National Water Policy and ‘Pakistan Water Charter’ to plan, develop, monitor, coordinate and manage its water resources. Countries such as China, Nepal, and <strong>Indonesia</strong> developed major projects to curtail the scarcity of water and to meet the increasing demands of their people, such as the ‘Mega Water Diversion Project’, the ‘Melamchi Drinking Water Project’ and the ‘National Urban Water Supply Project’ respectively.</p>



<p>Though the task at hand is very challenging, however, the current approach of the governments certainly has the capability of producing fruitful results for the people of this region in particular and of the world in general.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years there have been many academic studies, governmental policies, industrial plans, and much more to improve the management of water, reduction of inefficient use of water and to avoid a global crisis of water, yet, the world is still facing a problem of looming global water crisis. Although the situation concerning the availability of water is very bad and it may seem to be beyond any repair, it is important to know that the water crisis is solvable. Water is a renewable resource and therefore, lack of access to water isn’t a law of nature.<strong> Instead, it is just a matter of management, efficiency, regulations, infrastructure, funding, and most importantly, it’s a matter of sincerity in people’s efforts to preserve water resources and to prevent further depletion</strong>. In fact, studies also suggest that water scarcity can be reduced significantly by 2050 if the world commits to make some big, and practical changes. These changes, however, have to be multidisciplinary, which means that the water resources must be managed with a goal of ensuring equity in the economy and social welfare without compromising with the ecosystem.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Therefore, there have to be&nbsp; threefold solutions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Environmental policy:</strong> preservation and restoration of ecosystems as they naturally collect, store, filter and release water, such as wetlands and forests.</li><li><strong>Economic </strong>and <strong>Social solutions: </strong>improvement of environmental infrastructure and shifting to organic farming and other sustainable methods to reduce pollution.</li><li><strong>Engineering Technologies: </strong>designing technologies to benefit the environment and address water scarcity issues, such as improving irrigation technologies, rainwater harvesting, etc.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong>:</h3>



<p> The unwavering conflict between Israel, the world&#8217;s only Jewish state, and Palestine, consisting of the Arab population, sparked up the most controversial and polarizing issues within modern-day international politics, essentially over the power dispute in deciding who gets what part of the geographical land.</p>



<p><strong>Palestine</strong> is located at the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea, to the west of Jordan and south of Lebanon, consisting of Jordan valley and Ghawr, mountains and hills, southern desert, coastal and inner plains, whereas Israel is located at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean sea in west Asia, In the south, it has a small coastal line on the Red sea. It is surrounded by Egypt from the southwest, Syria from the northeast, Lebanon from the north, and Jordan from the east. (Please consider the map for a clear idea).</p>



<p>The unresolved conflict between the two countries fighting for the right to attain peaceful statehood existence, within the same geographical region of the middle east, began in the early 20th century. But it can be dated back to thousands of years when the Jews fled from persecution in Europe wanting to establish a state of their own. Still, it was resisted by the Arabs who saw the land as rightfully as their own As a result of which several wars were fought, with the majority of wars being among those fought in the year 1948 and 1967. The war of 1967 is of great importance so far as the current situation is concerning because it transferred the west bank and Gaza strip under the control of Jews.</p>



<p>The continuous string of wars between the two parties has to lead to a situation very difficult to resolve. It was difficult to make the west bank, which was essentially a part of Palestine, occupied by the Israeli military in 1967 along with East Jerusalem and Gaza strip, a part of an independent Palestine, which was the first and the foremost demand of the Palestinians because Israel had built settlements and constructed barriers which formed a de-facto border, making it difficult to decide, which part of the Jerusalem shall belong to, as both sides claim it to be their center. The dispute between the two sides regarding refugees is yet another crucial issue that needs thorough introspection. Therefore, the central conflict is essential regarding the Holy land, which is of greater religious, cultural, and political importance to both the parties in the disagreement.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Holy Land</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&nbsp;The term holy land usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern state of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and of southwestern Syria. The city of Jerusalem is sacred to many religious traditions, including the Abrahamic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which consider it a holy city. Some of the most sacred places for each of these religions are found in Jerusalem, and the one shared between all three is the Temple Mount.</p>



<p>Jerusalem has been considered the holiest city in&nbsp;<strong>Judaism</strong>&nbsp;and the Jewish people&#8217;s ancestral and spiritual homeland since the 10th century BC. It is given such a special status in Jewish law that Jews outside Jerusalem pray facing its direction and believe that God promised the land to the children of Abraham i.e., Israelis and hence the claim.</p>



<p>So far as the&nbsp;<strong>Islamic</strong>&nbsp;stand is concerned, Jerusalem is the sacred site along with Mecca and Medina because it is believed that the previous prophets of Islam had a close affiliation with the city and even the last messenger of Islam, Prophet Mohammad (saw) visited the city on a nocturnal journey. Besides that, it is also regarded as the first qibla and hence holds a great significance for Muslims in general and the inhabitants of Palestine in particular.</p>



<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>



<p> The conflict between the two countries gathered gravity in 1917 when the official support of Britain was extended to the Jewish National home in Palestine by Arthur James Balfour, then British Foreign Secretary, whose support was seen as ignoring the rights of Arabs of Palestine, which ultimately led to violence. When Britain was not able to control the fuelling of the violence, it withdrew its forces from Palestine in 1948, the time when the United Nations was created. Hence the matter is now to be resolved by the United Nations itself by taking into consideration the rights and claims of both the parties in the conflict.</p>



<p>The United Nations took its first in an attempt to solve the problem by presenting a partition plan which proposed to create separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine. The plan was accepted by most of the Jews but rejected by Arabs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, When Israel declared its independence in 1948, a war took place between the two states the outcome of which was that Israel controlled about 50% of more territory than was suggested by the UN. Jordan controlled the west bank, Jerusalem holy sites, and Egypt controlled Gaza, but the Jews were removed from inside of Gaza by Israel in 2005; however, it maintained tight control at the border crossing.</p>



<p>Shortly after in the year 1967, another war took place between Arabs and Israeli, where Israel seized Golan Heights from Syria, the west bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza strip from Egypt. Currently, the west bank is nominally controlled by the Palestinian authority but is under Israeli occupation in the sense that the Israeli troops enforce security Restrictions and the Gaza strip is the control of Hamas, an Islamist fundamentalist party with no ground troop occupation.</p>



<p>The year 1975 proved to be significant for Palestinians as the UN in year 1975 gave observer status to the Palestine liberation organization (PLO)and recognized the<strong> Palestinians&#8217; right to self-determination</strong> but irrespective of this recognition, violence continued between the two which led to the formation of Hamas in 1987, which is an offshoot of Egypt&#8217;s Muslim brotherhood seeking to free Palestine by jihad. It was in this year only when the tension in occupied territories of the west bank and Gaza reached a crucial point which led to the first intifada i.e. a war between Palestinian militants and the Israeli army.</p>



<p>After the grave violence which led to the wastage of thousands of innocent lives on both sides, PLO and Israel agreed to recognize each other and renounced violence under an accord called Oslo Accords in 1993 which led to the establishment of the<strong> Palestinian Authority</strong> which later received autonomy in some parts of the west bank and the Gaza strip.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Current Situation</strong></h4>



<p>  After the gulf war against Kuwait, where Palestinians supported Iraq, Palestinians lost financial and military support from Arabs(Zahler Reuben Israel Palestinian conflict, Oregon Hillel Eugene OR20 Nov 2014 lecture). Still, since the international community has recognized the problem of a Palestinian refugee, western nations came forward for support.</p>



<p>As far as the negotiation is concerned, more rounds of negotiation occurred like the one led by then US president Bill Clinton which is the camp David ii, but this too didn&#8217;t fructify and was followed by intifada second, &#8220;the Al-Aqsa&#8221; intifada which erupted between the two parties in the year 2000 which left severe and deep imprints in the entire region. By 2003, 2,400 Palestinians and 800 Israelis have died, leaving hundreds more wounded and traumatized (Bunton martin p. the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a very short introduction Np,97 print).</p>



<p>The former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon sought to disrupt the Palestinian authority&#8217;s economic and physical infrastructure (ibid.) Israel deployed tanks, helicopters, and troops in Palestinian territories. The aim of Ariel Sharon, the then Prime Minister, was to separate the Israeli from Palestinians and not opt for any negotiations.</p>



<p>The largely tumultuous decade of the 2000s resulted in more radical threats and further insecurity, intense military retaliation, and continual hardship for a daily Palestinian. When we consider the Gaza strip&#8217;s violence, there occur semi-frequent conflicts like the 2008 Israel-Gaza war, 2012 conflict, and the war of 2014, which usually resulted in protests across <strong>the west bank, IDF bombings, and ground invasions in Gaza</strong>, among other violations.</p>



<p>The Israeli Govt. has taken a strict stand so far as its dealings with the Palestinians are concerned within the scope of international humanitarian law because it continues to impose unjustifiable restrictions on Palestinian human rights, not allowing the moment of goods and people in and out of Gaza strip and by allowing the Israeli citizens to settle in the occupied Gaza strip. Gaza&#8217;s restrictions resulted in <strong>limited access to educational institutions, medical care</strong>, economic and other opportunities, clean water, and electricity, and basic needs, which left 80% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid.</p>



<p>The international human rights standards continue to be violated at Israeli forces&#8217; hands by firing live ammunition at peaceful demonstrators in Gaza and open fire operations. According to Al-Mezan, a Palestinian rights group, Israeli forces <strong>killed 34 Palestinians</strong>, and <strong>1883 were injured </strong>with live ammunition during the protests in 2019 as per the Gaza health ministry. These violations also resulted in unlawful attacks and civil casualties on both sides.</p>



<p>According to Israeli Group Peace Now, in 2019, plans for 5995 housing units in west bank settlements were approved by Israeli authorities, excluding east Jerusalem as compared to 5618 in 2018.</p>



<p> Israel&#8217;s cabinet officials approved the ex-post-facto, the outpost settlement of Mevo&#8217;ot Yericho in the Jordan valley, something that is illegal even under Israeli law. Besides that,<strong> the Israeli authorities also destroyed 504 Palestinian homes</strong> and other structures, while they with no construction permit in East Jerusalem or the West bank have given it under their control.</p>



<p><strong>According to the UN office of the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the demolitions displaced 642 people.</strong></p>



<p>Israel responds to the launching of rockets or incendiary balloons from Gaza, resulting in civilians&#8217; casualties by restricting Gaza&#8217;s access to territorial waters for fishers, closing Israel crossings to Gaza, slashing fuel imports to the Gaza power plant as a punishment.</p>



<h4><strong>Stand of the International Community</strong></h4>



<p>As far as the international community is concerned, different countries are being shown regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue.<strong> The US has recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights</strong>, which imposed and expanded aid cuts to the west bank and Gaza including the USAID projects, declaring that the US does not consider the Israeli settlements to violate international humanitarian law. The US states also penalized the global tourism company Airbnb under anti-boycott laws for its pledge to remove listings from Israeli settlements in the west bank from its website, and hence it reversed its pledge.</p>



<p>The European Union criticized the demolition in Sur Baher, Jerusalem, and the Israelis politician Netanyahu&#8217;s promise to annex the Jordan valley.</p>



<p>Even the prosecutor of the international criminal court, instead of commencing a probe into the Palestinian situation, requested the court&#8217;s ruling about the matter that Palestine is a state, for the jurisdiction of the concerned court concerning the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>



<p>In Feb. 2020, <strong>US President Donald Trump announced a controversial peace plan</strong> for the region that would legalize Israeli settlements in the west bank and East Jerusalem, allowing annexation of the parts of the west bank while Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel.</p>



<p>This proposal was rejected by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on the basis that this plan will not bring peace or stability to the region as it annuls the legitimacy of Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination. He said that it is an Israeli- American plan to put an end to Palestine&#8217;s question. But the Israeli ambassador Danny Danon considered this approach as a sane plan to end the longstanding conflict.</p>



<p>The US envoy Mr. Mladenov expressed hope that the ambassador will support the Secretary General&#8217;s call for negotiation for the conflict&#8217;s solution. He held that &#8220;in the absence of the credible path back to negotiations, we all face a heightened <strong>risk of violence</strong>. Violence, which will drag both peoples and the region to a spiral of escalation with no end in sight&#8221;.</p>



<p> As far as the world&#8217;s stand, with regard to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, is concerned, the bitter truth is the <strong>legitimacy of Israel</strong> is recognized by the non-Muslim countries who maintain diplomatic relations with it. But some of them have taken an unbiased stand and have criticized the Israelis treatment of the Palestinians and its occupation of the west bank.</p>



<p>&nbsp;When we look at the global public opinion, we realize that it is more sympathetic to Palestine, which has created a concern among the Israelis that the international boycott moment called BDS could pick up some support. This moment, which was initiated in 2005, aims to capitalize on Israel&#8217;s international anger by creating costs to Israel Palestinian policy through (BDS), i.e. boycotting Israeli goods and institutions, divestment from Israeli companies, and sanctions on the nation itself. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drags on, many Israelis worry that BDS will become more mainstream. It is believed that BDS could be a real problem for Israel if it fails to come to terms with Palestinians.</p>



<p>One of the crucial things that have become the <strong>cause of Israel&#8217;s poor global standing</strong> <strong>is the west bank</strong> because most countries believe that the continuous Israeli occupation of the west bank is an unlawful military occupation which violates the fourth Geneva convention (reference) which is justified by Israel by stating that it isn&#8217;t occupied. Even if it were, it doesn&#8217;t violate the fourth Geneva convention because it prohibits forcible population transfers, not a voluntary settlement. </p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Mahatma Gandhi, one of the peace-loving politicians of the Indian Nation has said &#8220;I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary. The evil it does is permanent &#8220;and when we consider this saying concerning the crises in any part of the world be it Syria, Rohingya, Palestine, Kashmir or any other conflicted area, one common thing is that it gets reflected on the eye of our mind, no matter how long-term the violence might be, its desired outcome never fructifies simply because power is violence and the more one tries to suppress a just cause illegally, the more such reasons will flourish. Therefore, parties to the conflict should realize this simple principle before it&#8217;s too late and should try to recognize each other in a rightful and fairway. As far as the Palestine-Israel is concerned, keeping in view of the unending devastation and grave violations of fundamental human rights, it&#8217;s high time for both of the parties to say no to violence, which is not going to be fruitful to any one of them instead of trying to resolve the issue more amicably and peacefully considering the emotional aspect and rights of both the sides. Besides, it is also vital for the International community to take an unbiased stand and contribute to the dispute&#8217;s just and fair settlement. Meanwhile, the UN is highly duty-bound to perform the function for which it was created and stop being a diplomatic, mute spectator, thereby contributing to global peace and security.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Human Rights are the basic universal and inalienable rights and fundamental freedom guaranteed to every individual against any inhumane and arbitrary treatment. These are the inherited rights granted equally to all human beings irrespective of ethnicity, nationality, race, color, sex, religion, or otherwise. The basis of Human rights is to treat everyone without any discrimination which includes civil, political, economical, social, and cultural rights in order to keep society equitable.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>These rights are not just abstract concepts but set out the necessary standards for people to live a dignified life. Human rights define the relationship between an individual and country and demands guaranteed protection from any unfair treatment and discrimination. Human Rights set out the choice for subjects to choose their govt. They are free to choose any form of Govt., whether democratic or non-democratic. In democracies, people can easily voice an opinion on their choice of the ruler while in non- democratic countries, it depends on the nature of the will of people to choose their ruler to whom they have submitted their wills.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Origin&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Human rights are thought to have developed differently in different cultures and philosophies. People around the world have different concepts of basic human rights based on their religion, political affiliations, or other factors. Human rights were first seen to originate from religious beliefs. It was believed to be God-given and human beings adopted those beliefs as opposed to natural rights. Later philosophers from early modern Europe like Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke developed new norms and traditions. Natural rights were not seen as merely moral claims but they were considered to reflect the most fundamental human drives leading to truly human existence. By the late eighteenth century, such ideas were used as a means of constraining the government&#8217;s sphere of autonomy as was expressed in the US Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and in the Citizen (1789). It acquired an international dimension when the Congress of Vienna attempted to abolish the slave trade which was eventually achieved by the Brussels Convention (1890) and formally outlawed by the Slavery Convention (1926). The horrendous memories of WWII, especially the “Final Solution” to Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs in the extermination camps of Nazi Germany, established a modern agenda for human rights at the international forums. The UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and human rights violations affected the domestic policies as well as informed the foreign policy decisions of states, which were until then given second class status at the expense of “national security”.</p>



<p>As far as non-democratic states are considered the chances of human rights violations are more given the lack of accountability of the governments towards their respective subjects. There is no system of check and balance, no free press, and no fair trial. This can make the conditions worse for the dissidents as citizens can be penalized on vague charges and face indefinite detention. In some of the non- democratic, authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Venezuela, Jordan, Cuba, Turkmenistan innumerable gross human rights violations have been reported and people are unable to get it redressed till now.</p>



<h4>Social Perception Around The Issue</h4>



<p>According to a Journal Published on “Citizens’ Perceptions of Human Rights Practices: An Analysis of 55 Countries” by Matthew Carlson and Ola Listhaug; The concept of Human Rights is said to be accepted differently in society and there is a limited agreement to what human rights actually means. They gave an example that most scholars accept the argument that Human rights are rights which include civil, political, economic, and social aspects as mentioned under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, they mention that recent global comparisons of human rights practices are likely to be concerned with narrow concepts that focus on ‘individual integrity’ i.e., the right to be free from torture, imprisonment, execution, or disappearance.</p>



<p>Further, it is agreed upon that Citizens of oppressive countries are likely to have more negative perceptions than citizens of countries with more appreciative human rights records and even believed that highly educated individuals are more analytical towards human rights violations in repressive societies than in less repressive societies. It is mentioned that the level of political terror within a country’s age, gender, opinion of an individual, will have a different approach of human rights conditions, depending on their life experiences, opportunities, and the amount of&nbsp;information available to them.</p>



<h4><strong>Non-Democratic Countries And Human Rights Violations Analysis:</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia has a Kingdom of monarchy ruled by King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is both head of state and head of Government. The Government has been responsible for various human rights issues like executions for non-violent offences, forced disappearance, and torture. The people are denied the right to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The Government has harassed, arbitrarily detained, and prosecuted dozens of government critics, activists, including women’s rights activists and members of the Shi’a community.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association and Belief</h4>



<p>Saudi authorities continue to repress free thinkers, human rights activists, and independent clerics. Activists have been sentenced to long term imprisonments for charges arising from their peaceful activism. Four prominent activists—Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sadah, and Nouf Abdulaziz—have been imprisoned and remained in detention without any trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Saudi authorities opened a separate trial of prominent human rights activists, Nassima al-Sadah and Samar Badawi before the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, where charges against them have not been made public. Saudi Arabia does not tolerate public worship by followers of religions other than Islam. Saudi Arabia has no written laws concerning gender identity, and judges use principles of Islamic law to sanction people committing sexual relations outside marriage, adultery, extra-marital affairs, and homosexuality.</p>



<h4>Criminal Justice System</h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia applies Sharia (Islamic law) as its national law. On April 23, 2019, a mass execution of 37 men was carried out in various parts of the country. At least 33 were from the country’s minority Shia community who had been convicted following unfair trials for various alleged crimes, including protest-related offenses, espionage, and terrorism. According to Interior Ministry statements, Saudi Arabia executed 179 persons between January and mid-November for murder and drug crimes. Eighty-one among those executed were convicted for non-violent drug crimes. Executions are carried out by firing squad or beheading, sometimes in public.</p>



<h4>Right Granted in its Entirety </h4>



<p>Women and girls continued to face systematic discrimination in law and in practice in other areas such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and the ability to pass on citizenship to their children.</p>



<p>Shi’a Muslims continued to face discrimination because of their faith, limiting their right to express religious beliefs and access justice, as well as their right to work in a number of public sector professions and access state services.</p>



<p>Some migrant workers suffer abuses and exploitation, sometimes amounting to conditions of forced labor. The kafala (visa sponsorship) system ties migrant workers’ residency permits to “sponsoring” employers, whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country under normal circumstances. Some employers confiscate passports, withhold wages, and force migrants to work against their will.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>hina</h4>



<ul><li><strong>A paramilitary policeman stands as tourists wait for the daily flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square before the closing session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in</strong></li><li><strong>Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on March 15, 2019. © FRED DUFOUR/AFP via Getty Images</strong></li></ul>



<p>In China, the human rights condition continues to worsen. The justice system remains in trouble because of unfair trials, torture, and ill-treatment during detention. LGBTI people face widespread discrimination and stigma in society. Due to inadequate medical services, they take serious risks by seeking unregulated and improper gender-affirming treatments. LGBTI people also face abuses in the form of “conversion therapy”.</p>



<p>The government continues to intimidate, harass, and prosecute human rights defenders and independent NGOs, by raiding their homes and offices. Even the family members of the activists are being harassed and detained. They are put under police surveillance and restrained from any movement.</p>



<h4><strong>J</strong>ustice System</h4>



<p>President Xi Jinping proposes to bring the legal system under the ambit of the Chinese Communist Party’s absolute leadership. Law enforcement and the judicial system remains largely under the control of the party. China has legalized arbitrary and secret detention, such as “residential surveillance in a designated location” and an extrajudicial system of detention (Liuzzi). These plans allow for solitary confinement which increases the risk of torture and other ill-treatment.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Religion and Belief</h4>



<p>The government has strengthened its restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. The authorities rigorously censor all media, from print media to online games.</p>



<p>Chinese authorities continue to tighten its grip on Christians and Muslims as China pushes ahead with the “sanitization of religion”, with a view to combating any religious activity. Many Buddhist and Taoist temples and statues, along with mosques and churches, are being damaged or destroyed at the direction of the government. There are various reports about the detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups continued in Xinjiang in “vocational training centers”, also known as “transformation-through-education” centers. An estimated up to one million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minority people were sent to concentration camps. Many religious figures, intellectuals, and academics have been detained in Xinjiang merely for exercising their rights to freedom of religion and expression.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>LGBTI people continue to face discrimination at home, at work, in schools, and in public. The authorities accept and claim to have implemented all recommendations on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression at the end of the country’s review process in the third cycle of the UN Universal Periodic Review in 2018. Two recommendations requested prohibition against discrimination in legislation, but there is no law that explicitly protects LGBTI people from discrimination.</p>



<p>The Human Rights defenders (HRDs) have been unable to commit to their work without any interference from the Government. The authorities systematically subject them to surveillance, harassment, intimidation, detention, and imprisonment. Many activists and HRDs continue to be prosecuted on vague and overly broad charges such as “subverting state power”, “inciting subversion of state power” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. Many are held in “residential surveillance in a designated location” on suspicion of involvement in state security crimes. This form of detention allows the police to detain individuals suspected of such crimes for up to six months in an unknown location outside the formal detention system, with suspects denied access to legal counsel and families.</p>



<h4><strong>Jordan</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A woman raises a Jordanian national flag as she stands amidst public school teachers demonstrating and demanding pay raises at the Professional Associations Complex in Jordan&#8217;s capital, Amman, on 3 October 2019. </strong></p>



<p>The authorities detain journalists and activists critical of the government or the King, demonstrators for demanding their and others’ release, as well as block websites of activists abroad.&nbsp; Jordan is a member of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the armed conflict in Yemen.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression and Assembly</h4>



<p>In February 2019,&nbsp; parliament’s lower house refused to enact a draft of cybercrime law presented by the government on the basis that the definitions were vague and that some provisions contradicted the penal code; the definition of hate speech was overly broad and risked severely curtailing freedom of expression. The authorities have blocked access to websites set up by Jordanian activists abroad seeking to record political developments and arrests of activists in Jordan. The authorities harass and detain activists and journalists who criticize the government or King Abdullah. Public protests organised without permission are stopped with arrest and detentions and demonstrators are made to sign a pledge that they would refrain from participating in the future.</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>Administrative detention against women is used usually for months and for discriminatory reasons, such as for being “absent from home” without a male guardian’s permission, or for having sex outside marriage (Zina), begging, or homeless. Women who become pregnant outside marriage face authoritarian detention and forcible abortion.</p>



<p>Citizenship laws of Jordan are biased against children of Jordanian mothers and non-Jordanian fathers, who, contrary to children of Jordanian fathers marry non-Jordanians, are denied Jordanian citizenship.</p>



<p>The Family Protection Department and the Ministry of Social Development continue to forcibly abort the babies from unmarried women, without consideration of the best interests of the child and mother.</p>



<p>Migrant domestic workers have been facing abuse by their employers and agents, and remain at risk of arbitrary detention by the state. They are detained after fleeing their employer&#8217;s residence without permission. Those under-privileged who seek work in order to earn money need attention from the state for their upliftment.</p>



<h4><strong>North Korea</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A commuter reads a newspaper while waiting for a train at a newsstand in a subway station in Pyongyang on June 19, 2019, ahead of a visit to the North Korean capital by Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 20. Xi will be the first Chinese leader to visit Pyongyang in 14 years. </strong></p>



<p>North Korea is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world with Kim Jong Un serving as head of government and ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, uses threats of execution, arbitrary punishment of crimes, detention, and forced labor to maintain fearful obedience. It continues restrictions on travel outside the country and incommunicado with the outside world.</p>



<p>The government doesn’t tolerate dissent. It has banned independent media, civil society, and trade unions, The Regime also schematically denies basic rights, including freedom of expression, association, and religion. It systematically extracts forced, unpaid labor from its citizens to build infrastructure and implement public projects. The government also fails to protect or promote the rights of numerous at-risk groups, including women, children, and people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2014 United Nations Commission of Inquiry (COI) report on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea)&nbsp; briefed that the government has committed crimes against humanity, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, and forced abortion. It recommended the UN Security Council refer the situation to the International Criminal Court.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>In 2019, Kim Jong Un’s government barred people from leaving North Korea without a permit, by blocking Chinese mobile phone services at the border, aiming to arrest those communicating with people outside the country or trying to leave, and broadcasting punishments imposed on persons caught escaping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The North Korean government systematically requires forced, uncompensated labor from most of its population—including workers at state-owned enterprises or deployed overseas, women, children, and prisoners—to control its people and sustain its economy. A majority of North Koreans are supposed to perform unpaid labor, often called “portrayals of loyalty” at some time in their lives. North Korea is one of the only seven UN member states that has not joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) and during the Universal Periodic Review, the government did not accept recommendations. This also goes against equality and ethical standards of treatment of labours.</p>



<h4><strong>Vietnam</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Environmental activist Nguyen Ngoc Anh (c) stands in a courtroom in June 2019 during his trial in Vietnam’s Ben Tre province, in which he was sentenced to six years in prison for “undermining” the government via his Facebook posts.</strong></p>



<p>In Vietnam, the Government has been committing various inhumane acts against human rights activists and has actively breached a number of human rights resolutions.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly</h4>



<p>Government has arbitrarily put restrictions on uploading content on Google, Youtube, and other online platforms. Media-censorship, limiting content, ads, and any news which is politically sensitive is termed as fake news. A court in Dong Nai sentenced two Facebook users, Vu Thi Dung and Nguyen Thi Ngoc Suong, to six years and five years’ imprisonment respectively, for reading and listening to materials on Facebook and distributing leaflets calling on people to protest against China and state oppression. They were charged with possessing materials “that aim to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam”.</p>



<p>Vietnam has banned the formation of independent labor unions, human rights organizations, and political parties. Those who dare to establish workers&#8217; unions face harassment, intimidation, and retribution. Labor activist Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung was imprisoned for helping to organize a strike in Tra Vinh province in 2010. Police immediately placed him under intrusive surveillance. Even after ratifying International Labor Convention 98 on collective bargaining and the right to organize unrecognized religious groups, Christian, and Buddhist groups face constant harassment and intimidation from the government. Followers of independent religious groups are subjected to public criticism, forced renunciation of faith, detention, interrogation, torture, and imprisonment.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Despite ratifying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various other human rights treaties, these states have been found grossly violating them and committing human rights violations on its citizens. Right to life, liberty, freedom of expression, right to dissent, protest, freedom of the press is being violated day in and day out. In order to bring justice and promote human rights, international communities and organisations need to put pressure on these states to amend laws, investigate crimes, and bring perpetrators to justice in courts.</p>



<p>There is an immense need for positive change vis a vis human rights, especially in authoritarian non-democratic states because the human rights situation continues to remain grim. Especially we can say this in the post- COVID 19 world because the governments all over the world are stepping into the sphere of individual rights and the states, in the facade of controlling the disease, are actively using intrusive surveillance techniques. There is also a role to play for human rights organisations to make the general population in non-democratic countries aware of the importance of human rights and put pressure on their respective governments so that every individual irrespective of his race, gender, religion, or ethnicity gets to live a life that is free from fear, intimidation or harassment.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><strong>&#8220;<em>Healthcare is not a privilege, it is a right. It is a right as fundamental as civil rights. It&#8217;s right as fundamental as giving every child a chance to get a public education. &#8220;</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;~Rod Blagojevich</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields. Physicians and physician associates are part of these health professionals. Dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.</p>



<p><strong>Types of Healthcare:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Primary care</li><li>Secondary care</li><li>Tertiary care</li></ol>



<h4><strong>1. Primary Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>Primary care includes the first place patients go for medical care. It refers to the work of health professionals who act as the first point of consultation for all patients within the health care system.</p>



<p>Primary care team members include:</p>



<ul><li>Primary care doctors also called general practice, general internists, or family doctors</li><li>Pediatricians (doctors for babies and children)</li><li>Nurses</li><li>Physician assistants</li><li>Nurse practitioners</li></ul>



<h4><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Secondary Healthcare&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Secondary care includes acute care: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury, or other health condition. This care is often found in a hospital emergency department. Secondary care also includes skilled attendance during childbirth, intensive care, and medical imaging services.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;secondary care&#8221; is sometimes used synonymously with &#8220;hospital care&#8221;. However, many secondary care providers, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, most dental specialties or physiotherapists, do not necessarily work in hospitals.</p>



<h4><strong>3.  Tertiary Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>This type of healthcare is known as specialized consultative healthcare usually for inpatients and on referral from primary and secondary healthcare for advanced medical investigation and treatment. The following examples of tertiary care services are plastic surgery, burn treatment, cardiac surgery, cancer management, neurosurgery, complex medical and surgical interventions, etc.</p>



<h4>Health System</h4>



<p>A <strong>health system</strong> is an organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to meet the health needs of target populations.</p>



<h4><strong>Key Components of a Well Functioning Health System</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>As per WHO a well functioning health system responds in a balanced way to a population’s needs and expectations by:&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Improving the health status of individuals, families and communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Defending the population against what threatens its health.</p>



<p>• Protecting people against the financial consequences of ill-health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Providing equitable access to people-centered care.</p>



<p>• Making it possible for people to participate in decisions affecting their health and health system.</p>



<p>Thus it also includes the healthcare facilities being affordable to people despite their financial conditions.</p>



<h4><strong>What Does Affordability Mean?</strong></h4>



<p>Although the “affordability” of healthcare is a common concern, the term is rarely defined. Affordability is fundamentally a function of income, spending, and judgments about the value of goods and services for their price. Affordability is mostly taken as an economic concept.</p>



<p>Much of today’s health care focus centers on the rising costs of healthcare. Today’s challenging economic situation has redirected much of the health care discussion to affordability, not simply health care costs.</p>



<p>As a generic term, affordability can best be defined as a measure of someone’s ability to purchase a good or service. It describes whether a person or organization is able to make a purchase without unacceptable or unreasonable sacrifices, with limited sources.&nbsp;Similarly, taking simple definition <strong>Healthcare Affordability </strong>generally describes whether a person or organization has sufficient income to pay for or provide for health care costs. These costs could be insurance premiums or direct health care service costs.</p>



<p>Health care would be affordable if all the classes of society are able to pay for the delivery of the service or when the states spend a high economy on the health systems and provide it at low costs or free of costs or through insurance and fundings.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Basis for Affordable Healthcare</h4>



<h4>1.   <strong>Right to Health</strong></h4>



<p>The right to health is the economic, social, and cultural right to a universal minimum standard of health to which all individuals are entitled. The concept of a right to health has been enumerated in international agreements which include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>



<ul><li>The Constitution of <strong>WHO </strong>defines the right to health as &#8220;the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health,&#8221; and enumerates some principles of this right as healthy child development; equitable dissemination of medical knowledge and its benefits; and government-provided social measures to ensure adequate health.</li><li>Article 25 of the United Nations&#8217; 1948 <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> states that &#8220;Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care and necessary social services.&#8221;&nbsp;</li><li>Understanding health as a human right creates a legal obligation on states to ensure access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality as well as to providing for the underlying determinants of health, such as safe and potable water, sanitation, food, housing, health-related information and education, and gender equality.</li><li>A States’ obligation to support the right to health – including through the allocation of “maximum available resources” to progressively realize this goal &#8211; is reviewed through various international human rights mechanisms, such as the Universal Periodic Review, or the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In many cases, the right to health has been adopted into domestic law or Constitutional law.</li><li>A rights-based approach to health requires that health policy and programs must prioritize the needs of those furthest behind first towards greater equity, a principle that has been echoed in the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Health Coverage.</li><li>The right to health must be enjoyed without discrimination on the grounds of race, age, ethnicity, or any other status. Non-discrimination and equality requires states to take steps to redress any discriminatory law, practice, or policy</li><li>Another feature of rights-based approaches is meaningful participation. Participation means ensuring that national stakeholders – including non-state actors such as non-governmental organizations – are meaningfully involved in all phases of programming: assessment, analysis, planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>2.   Core Components of the Right to Health</strong></h4>



<p>The right to health (Article 12) as defined in General Comment 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – a committee of Independent Experts, responsible for overseeing adherence to the Covenant. (4) The right includes the following core components:</p>



<ul><li>Availability&nbsp;</li><li>Accessibility&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Accessibility has four overlapping dimensions:</p>



<ul><li>non-discrimination</li><li>physical accessibility</li><li>economical accessibility (affordability)</li><li>information accessibility.</li><li>Acceptability&nbsp;</li><li>Quality</li></ul>



<h4>Why is Affordable Healthcare Needed?</h4>



<p>Affordable healthcare is needed because most of the population of the world is either poor or fall below the poverty line. Health conditions and complications do not affect only the rich and economically stable. These can befall anyone and every person whether poor or rich should get all the proper treatment and care required. For that reason, it is necessary that healthcare should be affordable to every irrespective of economical status.</p>



<p>Many health treatments like cardiosurgeries, neurosurgeries, diabetes treatment are costly and thus people who are economically weak are unable to afford these treatments which are necessary for their survival. Thus it is important that medical care should be affordable to all classes of society without financial hindrance.</p>



<p>The states need to spend more on healthcare systems to make it affordable for all.</p>



<p><strong>Healthcare can be affordable in two ways:</strong></p>



<ul><li>When the cost of delivery of medical care is low.</li><li>When people are able to pay for the treatments which can be easy when the government would finance healthcare particularly for the poor.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Universal Health Coverage</strong></h4>



<p>There should be a universal health coverage. According to WHO Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It includes the full range of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.</p>



<p>Currently, at least half of the people in the world do not receive the health services they need. About 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year because of out-of-pocket spending on health. This must change.</p>



<p>To make health for all a reality, we need individuals and communities who have access to high-quality health services so that they take care of their own health and the health of their families; skilled health workers providing quality, people-centered care; and policy-makers committed to investing in universal health coverage.</p>



<p>Universal health coverage should be based on strong, people-centered primary health care. Good health systems are rooted in the communities they serve. They focus not only on preventing and treating disease and illness but also on helping to improve well-being and quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>Asia/Pacific Health Coverage : An analysis of 2018 report :&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Health Status</strong></li></ul>



<p>Between 2000 and 2015, the average maternal mortality rate across lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries was cut by more than half, but it is still high at 140 deaths per 100 000 live births.</p>



<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in Asia-Pacific. In 2016, there were 10.4 million newly occurring (incident) TB cases worldwide, 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative people globally. One-third of new cases and one-fourth of deaths were estimated in India and Indonesia alone.</p>



<p>The share of deaths due to non-communicable diseases is increasing in Asia-Pacific. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers were the most common causes of death, being responsible for over 82% and 78% of all deaths, on average, across high and upper-middle-income Asia-Pacific countries.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Healthcare Resources</strong></li></ul>



<p>The supply of doctors is one per 1000&nbsp; across lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries and 1.2 per 1000 population – is reported in upper-middle-income countries.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The number of nurses is highest in high-income countries such as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, with over ten nurses per 1000 population. The supply is much lower in a number of low-income countries, including Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, where there are 0.5 nurses or less per 1000 population.</p>



<p>The number of hospital beds per capita is 2.8 and 1.8 per 1000 population on average across upper-middle and lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries respectively, lower than high-income Asia-Pacific countries average of 5.3, but it varies considerably.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Healthcare Spending</strong></li></ul>



<p>Lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries spend just below USD 200 per person per year on health, against USD 670 and USD 3 450 in upper-middle-income and high-income Asia-Pacific countries respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This amounts to over 4.3% of gross domestic product, on average, in middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries, compared to over 7.3% in high-income Asia-Pacific countries in 2015.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, high-income countries reported an increase of 0.8 percentage points from 2010-2015, twice the increase reported by middle and low-income countries at 0.4 percentage points.</p>



<p>The share of public spending in total health spending increased in all Asia-Pacific countries from 2010 to 2015, but it is much lower in lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries compared to upper-middle and high-income Asia-Pacific countries: 41.9% compared to 62% and 72.3%, respectively<strong>.</strong> Although there is some improvement in Asia-Pacific countries in the last years but yet not up to the mark. Countries in the Asia/Pacific region need to step up their efforts to give more people access to affordable, quality health care, suggests the 2018 report.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Management </strong>O<strong>f Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of policies and plans adopted by the government, private sector business, and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, pharmaceuticals, health human resources, and public health.</p>



<p>Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health are also important subfields.</p>



<p>Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of aging, and health inequities, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a vaccination policy, supporting public health programs in providing vaccinations to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.</p>



<p>The rapid emergence of many chronic diseases, which require costly long-term care and treatment, is making many health managers and policymakers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is HIV/AIDS. Another major public health concern is diabetes. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of tobacco smoking, linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.</p>



<p>Antibiotic resistance is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as tuberculosis. The World Health Organization, for its World Health Day 2011 campaign, is calling for an intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines for future generations.</p>



<h4><strong>Steps to Make Healthcare Affordable:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<ol><li><strong>Increase Spending on Healthcare:&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>There is not enough investment in the field of healthcare. Investment in public health departments needs to be made as most of these institutions are inefficient in providing services due to which people have to turn to private institutions. Early detection of diseases by providing better services through these public healthcare facilities can help in the efficient treatment and save subsequent expenditure.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Invest in Innovation and Technology:</strong></p>



<p>Innovation can help in driving down costs and offer improvements in the quality of healthcare. Certain measures like procuring, testing, and distributing generic medicines to public hospitals at low costs should be implemented.</p>



<p> 3.<strong> Subsidies and Benefits:</strong></p>



<p>Organizations that manufacture low-cost devices can be attracted to set up hubs by providing subsidies and developing hassle-free policies for ease of business. This will help the weaker sections to afford the proper healthcare e.g the biggest players in the medical diagnostic device field namely, Philips, GE, and Siemens manufacture low-cost devices in India.</p>



<p> 4.<strong> </strong>Health insurance policies help the individual by making <strong>medical expenditures affordable</strong>.&nbsp; Such policies should be supported by the government of all countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p> 5<strong>.</strong> <strong>Medical Loan:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Medical Loan is another step that will make healthcare accessible whenever the need is felt. The government should make medical loans easily available and accessible to all. Such loans should be simple, without any documentary and other formalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong> </strong>6.<strong> </strong>The healthcare system of a country should be affordable to all particularly to low and moderate-income families. It should be <strong>sustainably </strong>and<strong> justly financed.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong> </strong>7<strong>. Build the National Digital Infrastructure:</strong> </p>



<p>Governments must invest in the necessary telecommunications infrastructure that underlies an eHealth strategy.</p>



<p> 8. <strong>Invest in Human Capital:</strong></p>



<p>Governments and the private sector should share a mutual interest in and responsibility for training medical personnel and civil servants in technology capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p> 9. <strong>Develop a Regulatory and Legal Framework:</strong></p>



<p>Parliament or the national assembly cements a mandate for digitizing healthcare in national legislation, protecting patients, and enabling innovation.</p>



<p><strong> 10.</strong> <strong>Appoint an eHealth Government Agency:</strong></p>



<p>A centralized agency is best positioned to coordinate national eHealth projects across ministries; across the district, provincial, and federal levels of government; and with patient associations, medical associations, and businesses.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Health care is one of the most essential topics in the world today. Providing affordable and accessible healthcare to one and all are very important and various steps have been taken and policies framed in this direction. But, there is a need for better planning and execution to make healthcare facilities affordable for the large population through better policy decisions.</p>



<p>Affordability need not merely be met with finance capital or the ability to pay, it needs to be also viewed through the lens of the ability to seek services which make sense and appeal to the masses and the classes. When health care is more affordable, more people have access to health care.</p>



<p>That’s why health plans are laser-focused on making health care more affordable by changing the way that we pay for products and services and promoting reforms that provide more value for consumers and employers.</p>



<p>States should follow policies that create pricing transparency, ensure a competitive marketplace, promote value-based payment, and provide flexibility for health plans to offer products that meet the needs of our customers.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Road accidents are the most unwanted common thing nowadays. As the number of people buying automobiles is increasing, the number of road accidents is also increasing. Motorization although has eased life in many aspects, but it has come with a price. Road accidents claim over a million precious lives every year across the globe. World Health Organization (WHO) reports providing those road accidents are one of the leading causes of death, among other reasons. Road accidents are basically an outcome of an interplay among different factors that comprise the vehicle, environment, and the human being. India, which is a vigorously developing country, has its issues relating to road accidents due to the rapid expansion of motorization.&nbsp; Traditionally, road accidents are looked at as unpredictable, inevitable, and not preventable. However, road accidents are predictable and preventable in most cases. The only requirement is adherence to traffic rules and specific other precautionary and preventive measures. The adoption of preventive steps would help in decreasing the mortality rate due to road accidents.</p>



<h4>Contributing Causes of Road Accidents in India</h4>



<p>Road accidents mainly occur due to reckless and over-speed driving, not following basic traffic rules, overhauling, and poor maintenance of the vehicles. Below mentioned are some common driving errors which cause most road accidents.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Human Activities</strong></h4>



<h4>1.1 <strong>O</strong>ver Speeding:</h4>



<p>&nbsp;Almost 64% of road deaths are caused by over speeding. According to data collected by Save Life Foundation, almost 60% of the accidents in India occur on highways, mostly because of speeding. The most deaths due to speeding were in Rajasthan (9,618 deaths), followed by Tamil Nadu (9,224 deaths) and Karnataka (8,714 deaths). The current speed limit in the country is 80 km per hour on a 4-lane highway. However, the WHO has recommended that if we reduce the speed limit to about 55-57 km per hour, we could save around 30%-37% lives.</p>



<h4><strong>1.2 Drunk Driving:</strong></h4>



<p> Drunk driving is the other leading cause of road fatalities. Drunk driving is a serious offense and as per rules laid down by the court, any driver found with more than 30 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood is under the influence of alcohol and is a culprit of drunk driving. &nbsp; According to National Crime Records Bureau’s report on Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2015, about 1.5 percent of all the total 4.64 lakh road accidents were caused by drunk driving, resulting in injuries to 6,295 people. However in 2017 and 2018 accidents under the influence of alcohol or drugs has declined by 14% because of an increase in fines and better implementation of laws,</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>1.3&nbsp; Driving License</strong>:</h4>



<p>&nbsp;The statistics provided by a report released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways on ‘Road Accidents in India, 2018’ was shocking it shows that about 74% of road accidents involved drivers holding a valid driver’s license and 26% of road accidents are caused by drivers who did not have a valid license or were driving with a learner’s license, which clearly indicates that license is not signed that driver is qualified. For example, if we ask a driver about any basic rule of the road, like blind spots in their vehicle while driving almost 99% will not be aware.</p>



<h4><strong>1.4 </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Avoiding Safety Gears like seat Belts and Helmets:</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;As many as 48,746 people were killed riding two-wheelers in road accidents in 2017, of which 74% or 35,975 were not wearing a helmet. Likewise, 26,896 people killed in road accidents did not fasten seat belts&#8211;these included drivers as well as passengers.“Safety devices such as helmets and seatbelts do not prevent accidents but are critical for averting fatal and grievous injuries in an event of road accidents,” the road accidents 2017 report said. “Correct helmet use” can reduce the risk of fatal injuries by 42% and risk of head injuries by 69%, the World Health Organization’s Global Status Report On Road Safety 2018, said. “Wearing a seat-belt reduces the risk of death among drivers and front-seat occupants by 45-50% and the risk of death and serious injuries among rear seat occupants by 25%.”</p>



<h4><strong>2. R</strong>oad Environment </h4>



<p>The causes related to the category of road environment include (i) accidents happening in a particular geographical area (residential, commercial institutional, etc), (ii) those related to the type of road features including straight, curved, steep, etc, (iii) type of junction &amp; type of traffic control, (iv) weather condition, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Present Scenario in India</h4>



<p>Taking road safety as a serious issue, in 2015, India signed the Brasilia declaration and committed to reducing road accidents and fatalities by half. So far, the fall in road accidents has not been so satisfactory. In 2017, road accidents in India decreased by merely 3.27% with 4, 64,910 road crashes as against 4, 80,652 in 2016. Fatalities resulting from these accidents were an even smaller drop &#8212; just 1.9%. As many as 147,913 individuals have died in road crashes in 2017 against 1, 50,785 in 2016. This not so encouraging data is further marred by road fatal figures of the first quarter of 2018 which shows a 1.68% rise over the corresponding quarter. Road accident severity measured by the number of persons killed per 100 accidents, has seen an increase of 0.6 percentage points in 2018 over the previous year. India ranks 1st in the number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and the US. As per the WHO Global Report on Road Safety 2018, India accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the World.</p>



<h4>Policy Making And Policy Implementation Regarding Road Accidents In India</h4>



<h4>Position of Law in India</h4>



<p>India has the world&#8217;s second-largest road network and it accounts for 10% of the fatalities caused by road accidents worldwide. The laws which regulate the traffic on the road are provided under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The law gives in detail all the legislative policies and provisions with regard to licensing of drivers, registration of motor vehicles, state transport undertakings, traffic regulation, liability, insurance, offenses, and penalties, etc. The compliance of traffic-related regulations is enforced by concerned agencies which include Traffic police. The parliament of India has recently made an amendment to the Motor Vehicles act, 1988 to control traffic-related issues and to place stringent punishment for violators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Some of important traffic laws under the said Act are:</strong></p>



<ol><li>If a person is found driving with more than 30 mg of alcohol in 100ml of his blood, the police have the power to arrest that person without any warrant. Imprisonment for drunken driving may extend up to 06 months and/or fine up to Rs. 10,000 for first-time offenders and imprisonment may extend up to 02 years and/or Rs. 15,000 for second-time offenders. This provision is made to contain drunken driving which is a major cause of road accidents.</li><li>Two-wheeler riders are required to wear helmets and the maximum limit for riders is two on bikes etc.</li><li>If any person/s is found racing and speeding, the police have powers to arrest and imprisonment may extend for one-month and/or fine up to Rs 500 for first-time offenders, and for second offenders, imprisonment may extend up to one- month and/or fine up to Rs 10,000.</li><li>If a person is found driving despite being disqualified from driving, the said person would attract a penalty up to Rs. 10,000.</li><li>If a person is found driving an uninsured vehicle, he/she may be punished with imprisonment and/or with a fine.</li></ol>



<h4>Policy Implementation in India</h4>



<p>The Government and the concerned agencies are putting their best to stop the fatalities which are caused due to road accidents. However, India has one of the worst road-safety records in the world. As per data from Road Accidents in India 2018, over the last decade, more than a million people who are mostly aged between 15 &#8211; 45 years, have lost their lives on the roads.</p>



<p>The major reason for this failure remains poor enforcement. India has stricter Traffic laws than other countries but unfortunately, these laws are not enforced properly.</p>



<p><strong>Some of the critical issues which need to be resolved to make roads of India less accident-prone:</strong></p>



<ol><li>The amendments made in Motor Vehicles law in force are relevant to metro cities only. Its enforcement in the whole of India is irrelevant without an upgrade to the infrastructure of roads which includes road widening, removal of encroachments from sidewalks, and bazaars from main roads. First, a conducive environment for driving needs to be set up, only then heavy fines could be imposed on errant drivers.</li><li>It is the national highways that remain the area of concern where 30% of accidents and 36% of deaths take place. These fatal road accidents are majorly attributed to faulty layout or construction defects which include erroneous road designs, sharp curves, slippery surface, poor illumination, etc. Therefore the National Highway Authority of India would have to invest more so that the faults are corrected right away and road accidents are contained.</li><li>In rural India, road accidents deaths mainly occur due to driving without helmets, trucks, motorcycles, and tractors without proper lights; incautious construction of speed-breakers, and roadside Dhabas encroachments.</li><li>There lacks proper driving education and training among the general masses. Road safety education needs to be imparted to improve the behavioral factor of people which leads to accidents. Road safety programs need to be held at schools, colleges, etc.</li><li>India has a poor ratio of traffic police to the number of motor vehicles present across the country. This makes the task of traffic control and management very difficult.</li></ol>



<h4>Road Safety Measures In Low-Income Countries(LMC&#8217;s)</h4>



<p>The safety of road users is a global health issue because large proportions of unintentional injuries are caused by traffic-related crashes. According to the Global Health Observatory, 1.35 million fatalities occur on the world’s roads each year. This problem becomes even more critical in low-income countries (LICs), due to several faults in road safety standards, vehicle safety and maintenance, and in the design and implementation of policies and safe transportation infrastructure. With the aim of reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities and guide road safety policies and strategies, several steps at a global level are taken, many of which are coordinated through the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 developed by the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC) . Efforts at the global level have generally focused on the practical implementation of policies and standards to improve road safety in the developing world. There is no single remedy to make roads safer in low- to middle-income nations; the problem must be tackled using a mixture of new safety technologies and well-established approaches.</p>



<p>Government investment in road safety management, enforcement, and post-crash response is insufficient in many developing countries. This marks a stark contrast to the United States where, in the past 50 years, government-regulated adoption of improved vehicle safety technologies, including seat belts, airbags, and electronic stability control is thought to have saved more than 600,000 lives. While improving the quality of roads and post-crash care will help, the implementation of basic safety standards and legislation is a crucial first step in saving lives. For example, in 2014, the Asia Injury Prevention Foundation presented a study to the Cambodian government which stated that 561 lives could be saved, 10,572 head injuries prevented, and USD $98 million saved by 2020 if legislators made motorcycle helmets mandatory. Road users, governments, and businesses must work together to make progress on road safety in the developing world, and ultimately reduce the number of crashes that occur.</p>



<h4>Suggestive Steps To Avoid Road Accidents:</h4>



<p>To reduce road accidents Three E (Education, Enforcement, and Engineering) formulas must be followed.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Education:</strong></h4>



<p><strong> </strong>Educating the populace, and children in particular, about road safety and good road user behavior, can help to reduce the number and severity of crashes. Communities and families have a considerable potential to influence the young and road safety programs to need to be developed in support of formal school programs. Also, the drivers should be given training about road safety, in the modern world social media has great control over the life of people, a campaign can also be started on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram to educate people about road safety measures.</p>



<h4><strong>2. Enforcement:</strong> </h4>



<p> Improving road safety through enforcement of legislation can also help promote road safety. Just like speed limits, there are many other traffic rules which must be followed to avoid road accidents like, traffic signals- taking cognizance and observing them, parking control measures, following one-way traffic regulations, including strictness in issuing a driving license for a different purpose, strictly check on drivers, vehicle condition, patrolling of law enforcing persons, an annual check of vehicle condition before the renewal of vehicle license.</p>



<h4><strong>3. Engineering</strong>:</h4>



<p> Engineers who implement careful access management can improve roadway safety for all vehicles while also promoting pedestrian safety and increased access for cyclists.&nbsp; Designing of road surfaces to reduce slip and increase friction, selection of safe design speed, which means design for slow speed where pedestrians are more likely to survive being hit by a car than die, channelization (particularly at intersections), the width of shoulders, parking, curves, traffic control devices, minimize the number of entries/exits.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Roads are the largest sources of interconnectivity. They are the vital sources of providing social, financial, health, and tourism connectivity. However, if safety measures are not taken up, roads can lead an individual to fatal consequences. It may not be possible to avoid all the road accidents which no country in the world has achieved yet. However, it is possible to minimize them by discharging our responsibilities as road users. Lost money can be earned, outdated vehicles can be replaced, and torn roads can be repaired, but human lives lost can never be replaced. Hence let us all learn to use roads responsibly and enable other road users to become participants in safe road initiatives. However, there is also a dire need for compliance with the stricter traffic laws. There is a need to understand the fact that we have not jumped on the road to enter a race, overtaking from the wrong side, etc. we could reach our destination even without rash driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>&nbsp;The means of production are owned and controlled by private businesses and the government has no role to play in production or prices. It is also known as a free market economy or free enterprise economy. This economic system is dominant in the Western world, mainly.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy is one of the oldest economic systems in the world which emerged during the 17th century. Capitalist Economy arose from a systematic breakdown of feudalism as a social and economic system and the imposition of a wage-labor system in its place. It first started with merchants who were a link between customer and producer. However, they gradually dominated the latter by placing orders and paying in advance. Then became more powerful by supplying them raw material and paying wages for finished production. The Merchant then made the transition to capitalism by making profits from the ownership and control of means of production. As time passed by, mercantilism gradually evolved into the economic practices that would eventually be called Capitalism. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The Capitalist Economy is the most predominant in the current global economy. The USA, UK, Germany, Japan, Singapore, etc. are the classical examples of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Characteristics of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, private individuals and/or businesses own the capital good, that is, production. The production of goods and services is wholly based on the supply and demand in the market. The private individuals are unrestrained and without any interference from the side of government. They decide on their own as to where to invest the capital, what and how to produce, where and what to sell, and at which prices to exchange the goods and services.</p>



<p>Some of the chief characteristics of a Capitalist Economy could be summarized as:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Economic Freedom:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, every individual is free to make economic choices without any intervention by the government. This freedom applies to both producers and consumers. Producers are free to produce any goods or services as per demand in the market. Similarly, consumers are free to buy the things they desire. Also, the workers are free to take employment wherever they desire and investors are free to invest wherever they get higher profit.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Profit Motive:</strong></h4>



<p>The driving force behind a capitalist economy is the profit motive. Business establishments exist to make a profit. The motive for the production and sale of goods and services is to gain profits and not just to solely satisfy the people&#8217;s needs and desires. The profit motive is responsible for the distribution of resources, determination of the character of the business, and leads to variations in production due to improved and increased technology.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Minimal Government Intervention:</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;Capitalist economic systems are characterized by minimal intervention by the government. Producers and consumers are at liberty to produce and buy goods and services respectively. Government intervention is limited to the protection of private property and the provision of public goods.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Consumer`s Sovereignty:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economy, a consumer is considered as a king. The whole production frameworks as per the directions of consumers. Utilization of resources, the technique of production, and the output, everything<strong> </strong>depends on impersonal force consumer&#8217;s demand. The consumers are at liberty to buy any goods and services as they need and desire. The choice of consumers is not subject to any restraint.</p>



<h4><strong>5. A Two-Class System:</strong></h4>



<p>Under the capitalist economic system, society is divided into two groups of individuals: The capitalist class and the Workers class.</p>



<p>The capitalist class owns the means of production and distribution and purchase the labor power of others. The capitalist class regulates the whole production and distribution process.&nbsp; While the workers class does not own any means of production. They sell their labor to the capitalist class in exchange for wages. However, there exists conflict between the two over the issues of wage payement, working hours, and working conditions. The worker&#8217;s class always remains subordinate to the capitalist class.</p>



<h4><strong>6. Willingness to Change:</strong></h4>



<p>Another character of a capitalist economy is its ability to adapt and change. It allows the change and adaptability of newer tastes of society. It does not stick to a single trend; it changes with the change in society to satisfy the demands of consumers. It also focuses on overcoming inefficiencies within its economic structure.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Advantages of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>In the Capitalist economic system, goods or services are distributed based on mechanisms set by societies, instead of government controls or mandates. The primary advantage of a Capitalist economy is that every individual has some sort of control over their fortune in life. The main benefit of the Capitalist economic system is that it provides strong incentives and motivation to grow, produce, innovate, improve, and move forward constructively. Some of the advantages of the capitalist economy are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>It  leads to innovation<em>:</em></strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy does create conditions for innovations to grow and thrive very quickly, for economic infrastructure to be built with maximum speed, making possible rapid development. &nbsp;Business owners invest in development and research to create better products. To get more profit every producer takes the new initiative to develop new techniques in production. The best example of innovation is the changing shapes and features of cellular mobile phones from hand handled mobile phones to pocket-size cellular phones.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>It is key to success:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Every person residing in a society focused on Capitalist economic systems does have an initial chance to find out success in many ways. Some may work even harder than others as everyone is surely going to get an opportunity at some level. There is one golden principle that if you work hard in your life, you have somehow a chance of reaching your definition of success.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>It  promotes participation:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy encourages people to get involved in all possible aspects of society to create the best outcome for themselves. People quickly get involved with different business activities so that they can get more and more benefits and create more capital.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Capitalist Economy embraces skills:</strong></h4>



<p>There are people with tremendous skills in this world that are not adequately utilized. A capitalist economy allows businesses to tap into these resources so that they can innovate. These innovations also create improving chances to continue for this developing world. This will undoubtedly bring an end to hunger, water scarcity, and other potentially life-threatening conditions.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>It leads to Economic Growth:</strong></h4>



<p>With the business firms and individuals facing incentives to be innovative, this creates a climate of innovation and therefore economic expansion. This in turn helps in an increase in real GDP and leads to improved living standards. In a capitalist economy, economic growth is faster and higher because the investor or the producer invests in the projects that are profitable to him. From a global perspective, before the industrial revolution, almost 80% of the world&#8217;s population lived in poverty. By 1980 that number had fallen to 34.8% and by 2000, less than 20% of the population lives on less than $1 a day. In the average country that became more capitalist over the last 25 years, the average citizen gained a 43% increase in income.</p>



<h4><strong>Disadvantages of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>Despite various merits and advantages of the capitalist economy, there are certain demerits of it. Some of which are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>More emphasis on the needs of business and not on the needs of the individual:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In a capitalist economy emphasis is more laid on the needs of the business rather than the needs of individuals. If companies want to remain operational, then they must introduce innovation in goods or services they offer and should also try to reduce costs. In a capitalist economy, there can be a misallocation of resources which results in higher production of luxury goods, which in turn will make the necessary goods more expensive and out of reach of an individual. Taking an example of some businesses (Telecom or IT or Pharmaceutical Companies, etc.) these are growing in this pandemic also but the common man is still striving for essentials.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Less government interference:</strong></h4>



<p>In a strong capitalist economic society, there is less or no interference of government and due to this the resources available are being utilized by few individuals to create opportunities and it leads to consolidation.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>People with disabilities are neglected:</strong></h4>



<p>The main focus of the Capitalist economy is too non-disabled individuals. If someone is unable to be productive, no matter what either because of injury or disability, they no longer have the ability to contribute and such individuals are left behind.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Competition is dragged into market:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy only focuses on the best. This means that larger businesses with more capital workforce smaller companies that lie out of their niches. It also means that workers with superior skills are forced out to work that usually may have an average based skillset.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Not bothered about the environment and other social structure:</strong></h4>



<p>The primary goal of the Capitalist economy is based mainly on consumption, so almost all of the energy is spent on that particular purpose alone. There is no consideration given to the environmental and social structures of the society, and no responsibility is shown so whatever harm may be done in another area.</p>

<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years, the capitalist economy has evolved. Starting with Feudalism followed by mercantilism and then capitalism. The capitalist economy needs a free market to succeed. Distribution of goods in a capitalist economic system is done according to laws of supply and demand.&nbsp; In a capitalist economy, the best products are generated for the best prices because consumers will pay more for what they want the most. The essential reward of a capitalist economy is the innovation of new products and more efficient production methods. The essential feature of capitalism is the motive to make a profit. In a capitalist economy, there is rational self-interest that can lead to economic growth. However, like anything else, a capitalist economy has its disadvantages too. No doubt that the capitalist economy has surpassed economic growth more than that of other economic systems, but the concentration of wealth in the hands of few always remains controversial. The forces that lead to the success of a capitalist economy may also act as a reason for its failure; it is necessary to take appropriate measures to protect the free market from powerful private interests.</p>
