It is on 45% of the southern portion of the Korean peninsula,&nbsp; bordered by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea). The capital of South Korea is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/place\/Seoul\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Seoul (S\u014ful). South Korea has an ancient history and has come a long way since the Korean War, which ended in 1953. Despite the miserable conditions brought by War South Korea has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest economies in the 1990s. South Korea even joined the OECD(Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). No doubt, the country has <\/a>suffered grave economic poverty but it has emerged as a fully functioning modern democracy and one of Asia\u2019s most prosperous countries by today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>History of South Korea<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 668 A.D. various competing Kingdoms were unified into a single regime on the Korean Peninsula. These succeeding dominions maintained Korean political and cultural independence for almost a thousand years. The last of the ruling powers were the Choson Dynasty until the nineteenth century. Korea has survived many invasions by Japan and the Manchus of East Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the end of the 19th century, Korea made small success in relation to trade and diplomatic relations with western powers. By the beginning of the 20th century Japan, Russia, and China competed to take over the Korean Peninsula. Japan succeeded and annexed it over 5 years later after the Russo- Japanese War. This colonial rule was up to 35 years and after the Japanese were defeated in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union divided this peninsula into two zones. After two years, the pro-U.S. The Republic of Korea (or South Korea) was established with its capital Seoul. In the north, the Soviets put Kim II Sung as the first chief of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), better known as North Korea. South Korea\u2019s announcement of independence in 1950 led North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, to occupy its neighbor in an attempt to recover control of the entire peninsula. U.S. and United Nations troops fought beside South Korean forces in the <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/topics\/korean-war\">Korean War<\/a>, which cost some 2 million lives before it ended in 1953.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Social Progress<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>According to EAI Issue Briefing on \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Better Life For Girls Initiative\u201d by Eun Mee Kim, the South Korean administration has promised to make up to Sustainable development goals. In its development, cooperative policies, and implementation plans, it has mentioned that it will implement SDGs to the fullest. Even Before the beginning of the SDG era South Korea announced various initiatives they would implement while aiming for achieving SDGs. Many of these initiatives have come up because of South Korea\u2019s own experience. Various initiatives like the New Village Movement, support for education and global citizenship education and global health security, poverty reduction, social-economic development. \u201cBetter Life For Girls\u201d&nbsp; is considered an important factor to promote healthcare and education for girls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>East&nbsp; Asia is the leading subregion on the eradication of poverty and hunger in accordance with SDGs 1 and 2 of the United Nations. However, in respect of SDGs 11, 13, and 15 i.e., sustainable cities and communities, climate action, and life on land respectively, East Asia has declined in East Asia since 2000. All measured targets in Goals 4,5,7,11,12,13, and 14 which are quality education, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water respectively, can only be achieved through rigorous efforts with the situation needing a dramatic turnaround. At the Indicator level, the top five target that is in need of correction are protection of forests and ocean health, formal and informal education and training, the concentration of air pollutants, and the number of refugees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"532\" height=\"353\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/vsdPslJ1Q6YYkMGbUWlEPGI3bPRCD_BrbuimBhHx_ArK4aO1mxjPCUyskm7lH-VaK8mNztV__6XQ6LMuvWZPnhs0t68vpR3KHklNFpkCYX3W76Xfw5zip8Wzsbufk2Tcf9yGfw\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Comparative Study of Exponential Growth<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Measures are taken and the Government\u2019s role; According to the Economic History Association, The Economic History of Korea is divided into three periods;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The period of Malthusian stagnation up to 1910, when Japan annexed Korea;<\/li><li>The colonial period from 1910-45, when the country embarked upon modern economic growth; and&nbsp;<\/li><li>The post-colonial decades, when living standards improved rapidly in South Korea.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korean policymakers revived economic growth by encouraging native industrial films following other developing countries. The government targeted certain firms and gave them the privilege to buy foreign currencies and to borrow funds from banks at favorable rates. It also eradicated the tax barriers and imposed a ban on manufacturing imports with the hope that it would provide protection to the domestic firms and give them a chance to improvise their productivity through training and importing advanced technologies. In the 1990s&nbsp; relaxing Capital accounts followed which caused rapid accumulation of short-term external debts. This, together with a highly leveraged corporate sector and the banking sector destabilized by the financial repression, provided the background to the contagion of the financial crisis from Southeast Asia in 1997.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korean economy grew at an average annual rate of nearly 9% during the last three decades and per capita income increased more than a hundredfold. South Korea got transformed into an industrial power because of highly skilled labor. Economic Growth was seen to be slowed in the late 20th century. In 1997 South Korea was forced to accept a $57 billion bailout from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/International-Monetary-Fund\">International Monetary Fund<\/a> (IMF), which is considered to be the largest rescue in the history of IMF. The country also changed the system of large families who owned business to liberalizing its economy. However, the country recovered its economic growth in the following years and the country gained its economic growth comparatively as it entered the 21st century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the growth of educational institutions, commercial and industrial enterprises, many people fled towards urban areas from rural areas. In particular, Seoul grew almost 10 fold to about 1o million people at the beginning of the 21st century. The same sort of growth was seen in the media sector, especially newspaper and magazine publishing. A purposive program was also initiated for the country&#8217;s transportation system to expand and modernize it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The apparent social change in South Korea was the emergence of the middle class. Even a new elite class emerged from the habitual landholding class after the Land reform measures taken in the early 1950s and with the spread of modern education, which eventually vanished the once privileged Yangban (landholding) Class. As people migrated to urban areas there was a decline of the extended- family system as they started living in apartments as nuclear families and with family planning such significant social change took place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In regard to Women Empowerment, there were campaigns held by women for complete legal equality and even were succeeded to get enhanced property ownership rights, the right to register as ahead of the family in a new family register system (hoj\u014fk) that took effect in 2008. Under the older system, only men and their children were legally part of the father&#8217;s family register but not the mother. The introduction of the new system increased women\u2019s legal standing in other matters as well be it divorce or child custody cases or in matters of inheritance (adopted and stepchildren rights to be equal to those of biological children).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the early 21st century, South Korea achieved the aim of decreasing birth rates and less aging population by rapid urbanization, nuclear family system, and women\u2019s active participation in the economy and lengthening life expectancies. The overall population is expected to decrease in the next decades as the government was concerned that fewer children and an aging society would slow economic growth and destabilize the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/social-security-government-program\">social security<\/a> system in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/ghaf5c3Z5FLgLutzRZxPSp_as5K6S8FT8YvqZEVFIh3KD4hHA2AQh4rvZqjhQI1oojTCNilKxpzk7BbJ-MKbYHUtDJCKJpvk5An5dPbgeP64ujlcqdLp7zQaYiNofsJS76DfPg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>South Korea&#8217;s Developmental Model as an Inspiration for other Countries<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea is known for its fast economic development. It is perceived that one should learn from the developmental strategies of Korea. South Korea&#8217;s economic strategy began with an agricultural-based economy in the 1960s and became the 12th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP(Gross Domestic Product) by 2020. South Korea&#8217;s economic success is attributed to policy reforms involving opening the country to foreign markets. Export-orientated policies were an important factor in economic growth. South Korea is among the top 10 exporters in the world and its export percentage was reported at 44.01 % in 2018. An improvement in the business environment and Policies incentivizing investment in innovation were factors that have contributed to the increase in international trade and industrialization in South Korea. Such factors played an important role in uplifting investment, production, communication, and, eventually, economic growth, innovation, and technology being South Korean major factors establishing export competitiveness and led to the country&#8217;s significant economic rise over the past decades. The Human Resource Development, The adaptation of An Outward-Looking Strategy (Labor Intensive Manufacturing), and Raising funds to foster needed industrial development led to the Economic Booming in South Korea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other countries cannot achieve fast growth by just following Korean strategies as the economic, social, and political environment of each developing country are different. And there are strategies adopted by Korea which were important factors of growth but later on created problems. As every country has its own unique environment, it is not possible for them to adopt such strategies precisely but can follow some part of it after well consideration keeping in view their resources and infrastructures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea is one of the fastest-growing economies in the World. Despite the Korean war which rendered the country poor in a miserable condition, thus the country was not only fighting for economic problems but for survival. South Korea managed to be the 12th largest economy in the World. Major factors in the Country\u2019s economic development involve high levels of domestic savings, private domestic investments, and rapidly growing human capital. The Economic Booming of South Korea drives the attention of developing countries to follow their strategy. Considering South Korea\u2019s relatively limited geographical size, natural resources, and population size, an aging population increases the threat that South Korea\u2019s economy might have a downfall. South Korea needs to continue its support in innovation and a favorable business environment for the maintenance of sustainable economic growth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction South Korea is situated in East Asia and is the neighbouring country of Japan.
