<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;The U.S relations with Mexico could be regarded as indispensable because of the fact that the countries share land and maritime border in North America. Several treaties have been concluded between the two nations such as the Gadsden Purchase (an agreement between the U.S and Mexico, in which the U.S agreed to pay Mexico $10million for a 2, 09,670 square mile portion of Mexico) and the <strong>North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA)</strong> (an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico and U.S, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America). Both are members of the various international organizations including the organization of the American States and the United Nations.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that both countries have close diplomatic, economic, and socio-cultural relations, illegal immigration and illegal trade in drugs and firearms continue to be the causes of differences between the two countries.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin</strong></h4>



<p>The first border dispute between The United States and Mexico arose because of the reason for migration. In an effort to control the inflow of English-speaking settlers, Mexico banned immigration to Texas from The United States. With the independence of Texas from Mexico in 1845, it became a part of The United States as a slave state by the efforts of the then Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. As a result of the independence of Texas, Mexico ended up its diplomatic relations with the United States.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in a fix to make the Rio Grande River the border between The United States and Mexico which would make Texas part of The United States, the then U.S President James Polk in 1845 offered to purchase California and New Mexico from the Mexican government which in turn was refused. As a mark of retaliation to the refusal, Polk sent military forces to the Rio Grande, and a full-scale US invasion followed with the seizure of Mexico City.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the peace treaty of <strong>Guadalupe</strong> <strong>Hidalgo</strong> was signed ending the Mexican-American war which obligated Mexico to relinquish present-day Arizona, California, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and Nevada. In return for the war-related damage to the Mexican land, $15 million in compensation was paid by The U.S. In addition to this, the peace treaty also provided for the protection of the property and civil rights of the roughly 80,000 Mexican nationals living in The U.S.</p>



<p>In 1853, the then U.S President Franklin Pierce planned to construct a railroad to the Pacific ocean for which he purchased 30,000 square miles of land along the Mesilla Valley which runs from California to El Paso for $10 million. The Gadsden Purchase marks the last adjustment to the border between Mexico and The United States and also the resolution for an indispensable border dispute between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;Cross Border Issues</strong></h4>



<p>The U.S- Mexican relations have usually remained friendly, nevertheless, periodic tensions have emerged over some major as well as minor issues including trade disputes, immigration, border security issues, drug trafficking, border environmental issues, and water resource issues respectively.</p>



<h4>Drug Trafficking&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Drug trafficking is a global illicit trade involving the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of substances that are subject to drug prohibition laws.</p>



<p>Mexico plays a major role in the US drug control policy as it is the primary source of and transit country for illicit drugs like heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine, fentanyl. Besides, Mexico is also a major transit country for cocaine produced in the Andean region of South America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fWZTs8sSSUU2-1TpfTHRNLiQgJ_ZIUUfln5lgpzVGnslhPx6BV8VKhXnQFaCy3AvoI5-J9Y2W2WcJXKDY7pTznmMPIzQTAxjeO8VI4n2ahrMpX3iAiQNc1YgwffUQkDrDuDvQ6j3" alt=""/></figure>



<p>According to the Drug Enforcement administration (it is an agency tasked with combating drug trafficking and distribution within the United States) 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican drug trafficking organisations which are involved in<strong> drug trafficking</strong>,<strong> money laundering</strong>, and other violent crime continue to pose a greatest criminal threat to the United States.</p>



<p>In 1969, an aggressive search and seizure counternarcotics operation was launched on the U.S Mexico border, by the then U.S President Richard Nixon while declaring “war on drugs”. The government of the United States deployed the agents for the purpose of inspecting all the persons and vehicles crossing into The United States through the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GNUFpZZZsUCtSY6OIrEx9IwZ6h9SzjE9E_oWL63fWjzN1cYNkWRNZt0c3ITEzNKDL3WnYFBw4wABrQSgQBQmB5LFJrfdzjHHrp43jDdPojPIYW-UC5HZxRdVJOoA-kbVsVG3qzbV" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The United States created the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA and there was some counternarcotics cooperation in the 1970s and 80s. However, the killing of one of its DEA agents in Mexico sparked outrage in The United States which led them to pursue the <strong>unilateral strategy to fight the war on drugs</strong>.</p>



<p>Data on drug seizures at the U.S. border indicate an alarming volume of trafficking taking place in recent years. Since 2009, heroin seizures at the southwestern border have almost tripled, while meth seizures quintupled. However, cocaine and marijuana remain two of the most commonly seized drugs along the southern borders, equating to millions of pounds seized by the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>



<p>Since 2012, the number of traffickers apprehended at U.S. borders has steadily increased from 364,768 to nearly 500,000 in 2014. From 2012 to 2015 the U.S. Border Patrol has seized more than:</p>



<p><strong>8.2 million lbs. of marijuana</strong></p>



<p><strong>32,600 lbs. of cocaine</strong></p>



<p><strong>34,000 ounces of heroin</strong></p>



<p><strong>17,600 lbs. of methamphetamine</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7TMDOoQh6GGd4LUJZPZf3gxZd4Ui6buMH1gGfjYaeVQGcN1Nc2qtz6aBDH1wMHcAYGeV8U3GVWjMtH39bH-UVVF6pvE36zOo_De9MboaXTYWgBLRzOUuw0nzAhL1edEb3fXixs9n" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, despite the high volume of search &amp; seizure programs that have effectively stopped millions of pounds of illicit drugs from entering the&nbsp; U.S,&nbsp; drugs are still finding their way across and have a profound impact in many states along southern and coastal borders.</p>



<h4><strong>Unauthorised Immigration&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Unauthorized immigration refers to the migration of people into a country in violation of the immigration laws of that country or the continued residence of people without the legal right to live in that country.</p>



<p>Unauthorized immigration has always been a subject of greater concern between The US and Mexico with much emphasis on how to prevent unauthorized migration and address the large population of illegal migrants living in the United States. Mexico being the largest source of unauthorized migrants in The United States, the U.S migration policies including stepped-up border and interior enforcement have primarily affected Mexicans as more Mexicans have been leaving the United States than arriving. However, the Mexicans living in the United States, including those who are unauthorized remain the top priority of the Mexican government.&nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="497" height="289" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R1S_Xr_TH953RI-AZtFngmkrIRYvb5xzwp3IQsr2DaTOI-DGjyHUUGdxGQl6dZZwXTEB2L94uXW2iHu6oeLxv2cKTfG8MWpbIrYs751Aqu4KhGSVH6s4h2eQO19q-xNJyjI8eY8l"></p>



<p><em>Undocumented Guatemalans carry their belongings after crossing the Guatemala-Mexico border</em></p>



<p>While the concern of the US government over unauthorized immigration was on peak in the 1990s, it came up with the strategy for tracking down the unauthorized immigrants living in the&nbsp; United States including the enforcement plan increasing border security and granting power to local law enforcement in the Border States to uphold immigration laws.</p>



<p>Since the mid-2000, successive Mexican governments have supported efforts to enact the Immigration reform in the United States, while being careful not to appear infringing upon US authority to make and enforce immigration laws. Mexico has made efforts to combat transmigration by unauthorized migrants and worked with US law enforcement to combat alien smuggling and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>NAFTA and USMCA</strong></h4>



<p>In 1980, the then US President Ronal Reagan put forth the idea of the <strong>North American Free Trade </strong>Zone as a part of his presidential campaign. After signing the Canada-United States free trade agreement in 1988, the governments of the US, Mexico, and Canada agreed to negotiate on what became NAFTA but even after ratification of the agreement by their respective capitals, NAFTA faced significant opposition in both US and Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQ-1CaWpYLLpg4JHSeR1uYIdH0bAX3idFKX081cB76qDQVhHMsMMZqjKt_cpA8VAS-ZCvFQU0sAmREweX5zhl1EcfAfylM90o0MMH-RAW3ohUS7fTmRYAoibo47Yi8AkedV-O2Br" alt="" width="595" height="429"/></figure>



<p>Eventually, all the three countries ratified NAFTA in 1993, and finally, it came into force a year later, after the addition of the two side agreements to it, The North American Agreement on Labor cooperation NAALC (it is the side agreement to NAFTA under which each of the three countries that are parties to NAFTA agreed to enforce their own labor standards and to strive to improve labor standards in their country) and The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation NAAEC (it is an environmental agreement between the US Canada and Mexico as a&nbsp; side treaty to NAFTA which sets out objectives concerning the conservation and the protection of the environment as well as concrete measures to further cooperation on the matters between the three countries).</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of NAFTA:</strong></h4>



<p>•<strong> NAFTA</strong> <strong>eliminated barriers to trade and investment</strong> between the US, Canada, and Mexico.</p>



<p>• It <strong>eliminated most tariffs</strong> with the major focus on liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobile manufacturing.</p>



<p>• The agreement also sought to protect intellectual property, establish dispute resolution mechanisms and through side agreements, implement labor and environmental safeguards.</p>



<p>• NAFTA fundamentally<strong> proved beneficial to North American economies </strong>and the average citizens but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.</p>



<p>On the other hand, critics of the agreement argue that it was to be blamed for job losses, wage stagnation driven by low wage competition, and a widening trade deficit.</p>



<p>After US President Donald Trump took office in 2017, all the three signatories a year later reached an agreement to modernize the 25-year-old NAFTA with the <strong>United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)</strong> and all the three countries had ratified it in 2020. The USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020, replacing NAFTA. The new United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and strong economic growth.</p>



<h4>Cross Border Environmental Issues&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Environmental health and environmental quality issues along the US-Mexico border have always been a concern for several years. Transboundary and shared resources and conflict include the flow of raw sewage and industrial wastewater into the United States from Mexico which has caused health and environmental problems in the border region.</p>



<p>Wastewater collection and treatment system capacity has not kept pace with rapid population growth in the border region. Also, the aging of existing wastewater infrastructure has resulted in increased maintenance issues such as pipeline ruptures. To address border sanitation issues, International Boundary and Water Commission <strong>(IBWC)</strong>, The US Environmental Protection Agency <strong>(EPA)</strong>, and the North American Development Bank<strong> (NADB)</strong> have been engaged to construct wastewater infrastructure on both sides of the border.</p>



<h4><strong>Recent Development and Crisis</strong></h4>



<p>Since the beginning of Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign, U.S-Mexico relations have been in crisis. The bilateral relationships between the two countries have been seriously affected by Trump’s criticism of Mexico and its people, his threats to deport millions of undocumented Mexicans, his desire to build what he calls a <strong>“beautiful wall”</strong> on the southern border, and his express intention to abandon NAFTA. For Mexico officials and intellectuals, the current state of affairs has reached the lowest point in the two countries&#8217; relationship over the last 25 years.</p>



<p><strong>President Trump refocused the Merida initiative</strong> through executive orders on combating transnational criminal organizations and enhancing border security. Though Trump has praised Mexico’s enhanced efforts to reduce migration flows but criticized Mexico’s anti-drug performance. On the proposal of the Mexican government in 2019, a high-level security working group, with a view to combating organized crime and cross-border crime, was agreed to be created by the U.S government which includes the Merida initiative as one aspect of bilateral efforts.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">&nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="446" height="255" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UGZoOgorhfNXsWf39fCBNdvXsxhU-ihZjcthXZtUchl4zENe6dIs115Q8--BEfVhmZNjOVPLS5gotxrsHxZafzAwnBImoMtnIj5p0f6FwASBZVcGKenKU96ViWXf8Brkt5kbnJ-J"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trump&#8217;s         <em>Border Wall</em></p>



<p>Throughout Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, he called for the construction of a bigger, more impenetrable border wall with a view to preventing illegal immigration from Mexico along the U.S-Mexico border. In furtherance of this proposal, The Trump administration two years later announced new rules to deny asylum to anyone crossing the United States illegally. However, Mexico has substantially opposed the construction of the border wall as well as the Trump administration&#8217;s immigration policy for the reason that Mexico places high importance on immigration, not only because millions of co-nationals live in the U.S but also because they send millions of dollars to the country.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SeSq-AGPSV8eXwvB4bGAqsPTzj7oaHOyO8QjusUDyvyutk118CrOh2fk0Zex6RsR9iSqxMwGAXOA3C7g_1Z-i-I_sg7T2nApTjytvkZiQMC59X4fznIZ6C6fGgzWuYndV83x44V-" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>For the first time over the last 25 years, the U.S-Mexico relations have withered away. The structural system that has prevailed for more than two decades is now under considerable threat. Although USMCA succeeded in the 25 years old NAFTA its future at present remains unpredictable. The nature of the bilateral relationship is likely to change substantially if the U.S implements its immigration reform which will have an enduring impact on the economies of both countries.</p>



<p>The U.S government’s immigration reforms and the modification in NAFTA have adversely affected Mexican nationalism and the perception of the U.S. Thus, the consequence of Trump’s campaign and his presidency has lead to the collapse of the bilateral relations between the two countries on one hand and strengthened the unity of Mexico’s citizens against the US Foreign policy on the other hand.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong>:</h3>



<p> The unwavering conflict between Israel, the world&#8217;s only Jewish state, and Palestine, consisting of the Arab population, sparked up the most controversial and polarizing issues within modern-day international politics, essentially over the power dispute in deciding who gets what part of the geographical land.</p>



<p><strong>Palestine</strong> is located at the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea, to the west of Jordan and south of Lebanon, consisting of Jordan valley and Ghawr, mountains and hills, southern desert, coastal and inner plains, whereas Israel is located at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean sea in west Asia, In the south, it has a small coastal line on the Red sea. It is surrounded by Egypt from the southwest, Syria from the northeast, Lebanon from the north, and Jordan from the east. (Please consider the map for a clear idea).</p>



<p>The unresolved conflict between the two countries fighting for the right to attain peaceful statehood existence, within the same geographical region of the middle east, began in the early 20th century. But it can be dated back to thousands of years when the Jews fled from persecution in Europe wanting to establish a state of their own. Still, it was resisted by the Arabs who saw the land as rightfully as their own As a result of which several wars were fought, with the majority of wars being among those fought in the year 1948 and 1967. The war of 1967 is of great importance so far as the current situation is concerning because it transferred the west bank and Gaza strip under the control of Jews.</p>



<p>The continuous string of wars between the two parties has to lead to a situation very difficult to resolve. It was difficult to make the west bank, which was essentially a part of Palestine, occupied by the Israeli military in 1967 along with East Jerusalem and Gaza strip, a part of an independent Palestine, which was the first and the foremost demand of the Palestinians because Israel had built settlements and constructed barriers which formed a de-facto border, making it difficult to decide, which part of the Jerusalem shall belong to, as both sides claim it to be their center. The dispute between the two sides regarding refugees is yet another crucial issue that needs thorough introspection. Therefore, the central conflict is essential regarding the Holy land, which is of greater religious, cultural, and political importance to both the parties in the disagreement.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Holy Land</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&nbsp;The term holy land usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern state of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and of southwestern Syria. The city of Jerusalem is sacred to many religious traditions, including the Abrahamic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which consider it a holy city. Some of the most sacred places for each of these religions are found in Jerusalem, and the one shared between all three is the Temple Mount.</p>



<p>Jerusalem has been considered the holiest city in&nbsp;<strong>Judaism</strong>&nbsp;and the Jewish people&#8217;s ancestral and spiritual homeland since the 10th century BC. It is given such a special status in Jewish law that Jews outside Jerusalem pray facing its direction and believe that God promised the land to the children of Abraham i.e., Israelis and hence the claim.</p>



<p>So far as the&nbsp;<strong>Islamic</strong>&nbsp;stand is concerned, Jerusalem is the sacred site along with Mecca and Medina because it is believed that the previous prophets of Islam had a close affiliation with the city and even the last messenger of Islam, Prophet Mohammad (saw) visited the city on a nocturnal journey. Besides that, it is also regarded as the first qibla and hence holds a great significance for Muslims in general and the inhabitants of Palestine in particular.</p>



<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>



<p> The conflict between the two countries gathered gravity in 1917 when the official support of Britain was extended to the Jewish National home in Palestine by Arthur James Balfour, then British Foreign Secretary, whose support was seen as ignoring the rights of Arabs of Palestine, which ultimately led to violence. When Britain was not able to control the fuelling of the violence, it withdrew its forces from Palestine in 1948, the time when the United Nations was created. Hence the matter is now to be resolved by the United Nations itself by taking into consideration the rights and claims of both the parties in the conflict.</p>



<p>The United Nations took its first in an attempt to solve the problem by presenting a partition plan which proposed to create separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine. The plan was accepted by most of the Jews but rejected by Arabs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, When Israel declared its independence in 1948, a war took place between the two states the outcome of which was that Israel controlled about 50% of more territory than was suggested by the UN. Jordan controlled the west bank, Jerusalem holy sites, and Egypt controlled Gaza, but the Jews were removed from inside of Gaza by Israel in 2005; however, it maintained tight control at the border crossing.</p>



<p>Shortly after in the year 1967, another war took place between Arabs and Israeli, where Israel seized Golan Heights from Syria, the west bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza strip from Egypt. Currently, the west bank is nominally controlled by the Palestinian authority but is under Israeli occupation in the sense that the Israeli troops enforce security Restrictions and the Gaza strip is the control of Hamas, an Islamist fundamentalist party with no ground troop occupation.</p>



<p>The year 1975 proved to be significant for Palestinians as the UN in year 1975 gave observer status to the Palestine liberation organization (PLO)and recognized the<strong> Palestinians&#8217; right to self-determination</strong> but irrespective of this recognition, violence continued between the two which led to the formation of Hamas in 1987, which is an offshoot of Egypt&#8217;s Muslim brotherhood seeking to free Palestine by jihad. It was in this year only when the tension in occupied territories of the west bank and Gaza reached a crucial point which led to the first intifada i.e. a war between Palestinian militants and the Israeli army.</p>



<p>After the grave violence which led to the wastage of thousands of innocent lives on both sides, PLO and Israel agreed to recognize each other and renounced violence under an accord called Oslo Accords in 1993 which led to the establishment of the<strong> Palestinian Authority</strong> which later received autonomy in some parts of the west bank and the Gaza strip.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Current Situation</strong></h4>



<p>  After the gulf war against Kuwait, where Palestinians supported Iraq, Palestinians lost financial and military support from Arabs(Zahler Reuben Israel Palestinian conflict, Oregon Hillel Eugene OR20 Nov 2014 lecture). Still, since the international community has recognized the problem of a Palestinian refugee, western nations came forward for support.</p>



<p>As far as the negotiation is concerned, more rounds of negotiation occurred like the one led by then US president Bill Clinton which is the camp David ii, but this too didn&#8217;t fructify and was followed by intifada second, &#8220;the Al-Aqsa&#8221; intifada which erupted between the two parties in the year 2000 which left severe and deep imprints in the entire region. By 2003, 2,400 Palestinians and 800 Israelis have died, leaving hundreds more wounded and traumatized (Bunton martin p. the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a very short introduction Np,97 print).</p>



<p>The former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon sought to disrupt the Palestinian authority&#8217;s economic and physical infrastructure (ibid.) Israel deployed tanks, helicopters, and troops in Palestinian territories. The aim of Ariel Sharon, the then Prime Minister, was to separate the Israeli from Palestinians and not opt for any negotiations.</p>



<p>The largely tumultuous decade of the 2000s resulted in more radical threats and further insecurity, intense military retaliation, and continual hardship for a daily Palestinian. When we consider the Gaza strip&#8217;s violence, there occur semi-frequent conflicts like the 2008 Israel-Gaza war, 2012 conflict, and the war of 2014, which usually resulted in protests across <strong>the west bank, IDF bombings, and ground invasions in Gaza</strong>, among other violations.</p>



<p>The Israeli Govt. has taken a strict stand so far as its dealings with the Palestinians are concerned within the scope of international humanitarian law because it continues to impose unjustifiable restrictions on Palestinian human rights, not allowing the moment of goods and people in and out of Gaza strip and by allowing the Israeli citizens to settle in the occupied Gaza strip. Gaza&#8217;s restrictions resulted in <strong>limited access to educational institutions, medical care</strong>, economic and other opportunities, clean water, and electricity, and basic needs, which left 80% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid.</p>



<p>The international human rights standards continue to be violated at Israeli forces&#8217; hands by firing live ammunition at peaceful demonstrators in Gaza and open fire operations. According to Al-Mezan, a Palestinian rights group, Israeli forces <strong>killed 34 Palestinians</strong>, and <strong>1883 were injured </strong>with live ammunition during the protests in 2019 as per the Gaza health ministry. These violations also resulted in unlawful attacks and civil casualties on both sides.</p>



<p>According to Israeli Group Peace Now, in 2019, plans for 5995 housing units in west bank settlements were approved by Israeli authorities, excluding east Jerusalem as compared to 5618 in 2018.</p>



<p> Israel&#8217;s cabinet officials approved the ex-post-facto, the outpost settlement of Mevo&#8217;ot Yericho in the Jordan valley, something that is illegal even under Israeli law. Besides that,<strong> the Israeli authorities also destroyed 504 Palestinian homes</strong> and other structures, while they with no construction permit in East Jerusalem or the West bank have given it under their control.</p>



<p><strong>According to the UN office of the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the demolitions displaced 642 people.</strong></p>



<p>Israel responds to the launching of rockets or incendiary balloons from Gaza, resulting in civilians&#8217; casualties by restricting Gaza&#8217;s access to territorial waters for fishers, closing Israel crossings to Gaza, slashing fuel imports to the Gaza power plant as a punishment.</p>



<h4><strong>Stand of the International Community</strong></h4>



<p>As far as the international community is concerned, different countries are being shown regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue.<strong> The US has recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights</strong>, which imposed and expanded aid cuts to the west bank and Gaza including the USAID projects, declaring that the US does not consider the Israeli settlements to violate international humanitarian law. The US states also penalized the global tourism company Airbnb under anti-boycott laws for its pledge to remove listings from Israeli settlements in the west bank from its website, and hence it reversed its pledge.</p>



<p>The European Union criticized the demolition in Sur Baher, Jerusalem, and the Israelis politician Netanyahu&#8217;s promise to annex the Jordan valley.</p>



<p>Even the prosecutor of the international criminal court, instead of commencing a probe into the Palestinian situation, requested the court&#8217;s ruling about the matter that Palestine is a state, for the jurisdiction of the concerned court concerning the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>



<p>In Feb. 2020, <strong>US President Donald Trump announced a controversial peace plan</strong> for the region that would legalize Israeli settlements in the west bank and East Jerusalem, allowing annexation of the parts of the west bank while Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel.</p>



<p>This proposal was rejected by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on the basis that this plan will not bring peace or stability to the region as it annuls the legitimacy of Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination. He said that it is an Israeli- American plan to put an end to Palestine&#8217;s question. But the Israeli ambassador Danny Danon considered this approach as a sane plan to end the longstanding conflict.</p>



<p>The US envoy Mr. Mladenov expressed hope that the ambassador will support the Secretary General&#8217;s call for negotiation for the conflict&#8217;s solution. He held that &#8220;in the absence of the credible path back to negotiations, we all face a heightened <strong>risk of violence</strong>. Violence, which will drag both peoples and the region to a spiral of escalation with no end in sight&#8221;.</p>



<p> As far as the world&#8217;s stand, with regard to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, is concerned, the bitter truth is the <strong>legitimacy of Israel</strong> is recognized by the non-Muslim countries who maintain diplomatic relations with it. But some of them have taken an unbiased stand and have criticized the Israelis treatment of the Palestinians and its occupation of the west bank.</p>



<p>&nbsp;When we look at the global public opinion, we realize that it is more sympathetic to Palestine, which has created a concern among the Israelis that the international boycott moment called BDS could pick up some support. This moment, which was initiated in 2005, aims to capitalize on Israel&#8217;s international anger by creating costs to Israel Palestinian policy through (BDS), i.e. boycotting Israeli goods and institutions, divestment from Israeli companies, and sanctions on the nation itself. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drags on, many Israelis worry that BDS will become more mainstream. It is believed that BDS could be a real problem for Israel if it fails to come to terms with Palestinians.</p>



<p>One of the crucial things that have become the <strong>cause of Israel&#8217;s poor global standing</strong> <strong>is the west bank</strong> because most countries believe that the continuous Israeli occupation of the west bank is an unlawful military occupation which violates the fourth Geneva convention (reference) which is justified by Israel by stating that it isn&#8217;t occupied. Even if it were, it doesn&#8217;t violate the fourth Geneva convention because it prohibits forcible population transfers, not a voluntary settlement. </p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Mahatma Gandhi, one of the peace-loving politicians of the Indian Nation has said &#8220;I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary. The evil it does is permanent &#8220;and when we consider this saying concerning the crises in any part of the world be it Syria, Rohingya, Palestine, Kashmir or any other conflicted area, one common thing is that it gets reflected on the eye of our mind, no matter how long-term the violence might be, its desired outcome never fructifies simply because power is violence and the more one tries to suppress a just cause illegally, the more such reasons will flourish. Therefore, parties to the conflict should realize this simple principle before it&#8217;s too late and should try to recognize each other in a rightful and fairway. As far as the Palestine-Israel is concerned, keeping in view of the unending devastation and grave violations of fundamental human rights, it&#8217;s high time for both of the parties to say no to violence, which is not going to be fruitful to any one of them instead of trying to resolve the issue more amicably and peacefully considering the emotional aspect and rights of both the sides. Besides, it is also vital for the International community to take an unbiased stand and contribute to the dispute&#8217;s just and fair settlement. Meanwhile, the UN is highly duty-bound to perform the function for which it was created and stop being a diplomatic, mute spectator, thereby contributing to global peace and security.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>There has always been a diplomatic correlation across the Korean Peninsula. Which is situated in East Asia, extending southwards up to 684 miles from continental Asia into the Pacific Ocean. The inter-Korean relations have experienced a lot of ups and downs, from hostile confrontations and terrorist attacks to summit meetings, since the division and subsequent Korean War. The conflicts between North and South Korea have immensely affected the civilians in terms of loss of their lives, torn family ties, huge infrastructure destructions, and much more.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there have been attempts by both sides as well as the United Nations with the help of different states to sort out their issues. Yet, no significant event of reconciliation can be marked.<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/tcduxXgq3Hvn9FRE9"></a></p>



<h4><strong>Historical Perspective of the dispute:</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Pre War Scenario</strong></li></ul>



<p>Korea was once part of the Mongolian Empire and it was ruled by China. In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, Korea became an independent empire for a while before being conquered by Japan. Throughout the Japanese rule, Koreans faced a lot of problems to preserve their culture. However, it continued to hold together and gained its independence piece by piece.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Division of the Peninsula</strong></li></ul>



<p>After Japan surrendered at the end of World War II, Korea became independent, but the United States and Soviet Union agreed in 1945 to divide the country for administrative purposes at the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel, in order to disarm the Japanese army from Korea. Meanwhile, a decision could not be agreed upon that would unify Korea. Further, the US government became anxious at the possibility of Korea falling under Soviet dominance. Therefore, the government of the US requested Soviet forces to stop its advancement at the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel north and to abandon the south of the peninsula, including the capital city Seoul, so that it can be inhabited by the US.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Arrival of Soviet Union and United states.</strong></li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same year, the Soviet army made its way into Pyongyang (the present-day capital of North Korea) and set up a military government over it and on the other side, US forces arrived in the south and established the United States Army Military Government in Southern Korea.</p>



<p>Later, the war-time synergy between the Soviet Union and the US worsened as the cold war took place. The Soviet Union supported Korean communists in North Korea and Kim Il-Sung, who had assisted in the Soviet Army, became the major political figure while as in the South, anti-communist Syngman Rhee appeared as the most eminent politician.</p>



<p>Besides, the US government took the matter to the United Nations, resulting in the formation of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK). However, the Soviet Union was against this move. Consequently, the general elections were held by UNTCOK in the south, due to which the Republic of Korea got established with Syngman Rhee as its President, replacing the US military occupation on 15 August 1947. In North Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was established with Kim Il-sung, as its Prime Minister.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Korean War (1950-1953)</strong></li></ul>



<p>The real war began when North Korea invaded the South. It was backed by the Chinese government and the Soviet Union, crossed the 38th parallel, and attacked South Korean forces. The United Nations Security Council in response to this act of North aided South Korea and sent forces immediately. Out of twenty-one countries who militarily aided, primary support came from the US. The support of the US was more for the quelling of the concept of communism rather than putting an end to the Korean border dispute. Moreover, it believed if they let Korea down, the Soviets will swallow up places one after another.</p>



<p>The North Korean army was much more trained and equipped and had high morale as compared to the South Korean army and allies, they could not stand the fight and were dying because of thirst and dangerous diseases. It was evident from their condition that they were on the verge of defeat. Here, the US desperately needed to relieve pressure on its forces, so it was decided that an amphibious invasion behind North Korean forces would be launched. The plan was risky, but it was successful, the North Korean forces were cut off from their supply lines and forced to fight on two fronts at the same time. This attack was a complete surprise to the north and the landing forces met with relatively little resistance. They were forced to go back to Pyongyang. This was a victory for the South and consequently, peace talks were held at a border village known as Panmunjom. For the first time in history, in the subsequent years jet fighters engaged in air to air fights, negotiations were impeded, combat continued and neither party could come to an agreement.&nbsp; <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/owvB7Py2koPwKw7N7"></a></p>



<ul><li><strong>Signing of Armistice.</strong></li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, both the Koreas signed an armistice (an agreement between two countries who are at war that they will stop fighting). However, Syngman Rhee was against this, who tried to sabotage the arrangements for freedom of prisoners and conducted protest rallies against the armistice. Even when he refused to sign the agreement, unwillingly he had to abide by it. This armistice led to an official ceasefire, but not to an official peace treaty. A new boundary was drawn and a two-mile-wide demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two states was created. Despite its name, this border continues to be heavily militarized.<img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AF3EoOQ-7ayOT2yiSgAR6nuemiqqDHbdtyhFCoZSVmWoaDeJuP_CucGYSEXwEcV8XVk1VBEmmExDBRzdR8ZrW5P836r4aMoU6ln97Tc87ugJgntm_JKorG3BpxG5K98Zfemm3g" width="479" height="291"></p>



<p>It is reported that even after this armistice was signed, North Korea has announced at least six times that it would no longer abide by it.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of the War</strong></h4>



<p>This war proved to be disastrous for all of the Korea in the following ways:</p>



<ol><li>The first effect of the war was the loss of lives. In the three years of War, around 5 million people died. More than half of these were civilians. Also, 40,000 Americans were killed and lacs were injured. Though the War was relatively short, the rate of civilian casualties was more than that of World War II and the Vietnam War.  <img loading="lazy" width="602" height="353" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oo4wyBnzpJfgPKAraXd2GG17XX4a3nAAchGsZDEbx6c-c8u6NHRMVx3kaoaFZ7S_uqbyizMtE73Y9I27_TsbKGoZ0b93hEph5nwsqTNu1060WRNk6gliOk_t1FW-qAKmlORKlA"></li><li>Countless families were separated for decades; they had to live on two opposite sides of the demilitarized zone. They were not allowed to meet each other or even communicate. Although Red Cross has so far reunified over 20,000 family members, reunions were no longer allowed as tensions rose on the peninsula.<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/DfRM5vU1MkVicMx57"></a></li><li>The War proved to be devastating majorly for the industrial development of Korea, as half of the industries were damaged in the War and skilled laborers, employees also lost their lives. It damaged industrial infrastructure altogether with leaving thousands of people unemployed, struggling to fulfill their basic needs. </li><li>As US soldiers still remained in South Korea, it irritated the Chinese government and put a great impact on the relations between the two countries (US and China).</li><li>After the Soviet Union and China withdrew its support from North Korea it fell into poverty, having the highest military expenditure in the world. It remained a developing country with a great deal of famine, where people are reportedly oppressed and tortured. The press is also controlled by the state. Therefore, North Korea became isolated from the world. While on the other hand South Korea, earlier being under-developed and heavily dependent on foreign aid, transformed into a developmental powerhouse. Its economy grew at an average annual rate of 9% and per capita income increased more than a hundredfold. </li><li>Another long term effect was that War led to huge American rearmament. Their defense budget shot up to billions of dollars.</li><li>After all these years, the effects of the War still persist, there have been hundreds of cross-border incidents reported such as bombings, hijackings, espionages, kidnappings, assassinations, and shellings. 1968 being the deadliest year where 148 people were killed in cross-border incidents.</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>Post War Scenario.</strong></li></ul>



<p>The aftermath of the Korean War built tension between all the superpowers. It was important for the cold war, as it showed that two superpowers would fight a “proxy war” in another country. Being the first of its kind wherein, the United Nations participated. After the war, US forces stayed in the South but Chinese forces left and the conflict continued. On one hand, defense treaties were signed between the US and South Korea and on the other hand between North Korea, USSR, and china. Moreover, South Korea became an anti-communist military dictatorship till its first election while North Korea an orthodox communist dictatorship.</p>



<p>The dispute between the two elevated with the back-to-back armed clashes known as the Korean DMZ conflict. Since then, both sides kept on attempting to harm each other in one way or another. Later, the US removed its troops from the South and by the end of the cold war, the north also lost its support of the Soviet Union. By then, North Korea had started to develop nuclear weapons and missiles.</p>



<h4><strong>Reconciliation Efforts</strong></h4>



<p>The first-ever contact was carried out by the South Korean government in the form of a secret negotiation with the North for national reunification. However, the dialogue was short-lived. Then, by the end of the previous century, there was a sign of the restoration of harmony between the two states. But, North Korea’s nuclear weapon abilities became a source of tension for the South. Also, the then South Korean President initiated a policy (known as sunshine policy) in order to restore good relations with the North. A joint North-South industrial complex was built for the facilitation of trade at Kaesong (a city in North Korea). Things appeared to get better when North and South Korean athletes marched under a single flag at the summer Olympics to present the Korean peninsula. However, the policy was later abandoned because of the provocations by the North through active nuclear weapon testing. Consequently, the UN also issued a travel ban on the North and blocked their accounts. As a response to this, North Korea among other things revoked the 1953 sealed ceasefire agreement with the South.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the South Korean president’s hard approach towards Pyongyang, North Korea nullified all the military and political agreements with the South. In addition to this, it canceled all the business contracts relating to the Kaesong industrial complex. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/1q422f5rxNDLYqt27"></a></p>



<ul><li><strong>Summit Meeting.</strong></li></ul>



<p>In 2018, the two presidents (Kim jong-un and Moon-Jae-in) met in a summit wherein the former agreed to denuclearize North Korea if the United States also agreed to peace treaties. Accordingly, in order to prevent clashes, end hostility on land, sea, and air the governments established buffer zones across DMZ. However, recently North Korea destroyed an inter-Korean joint liaison office with missiles, calling South Korea an enemy and not a partner for pacification.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>It is difficult to alter the essence of inter-Korean relations but almost impossible to unify them. In fact, the series of terms of exchange and cooperation between them failed to harmonize their relationship. The main cause can be the difference of unchanging perspectives of both sides pertaining to the unification of the Korean Peninsula.</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, unification is not the most important matter here, as is the threat to the peace of civilians of South as well as North. Rightly stated in a Korean proverb, that when two whales fight, it is the small fish that are devoured in the process. The war, though called “ limited”, led to large painful casualties of Americans, Chinese, troops of various countries, and most of all to the people of Korea.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The doctrine of humanitarian intervention is one of the most contested issues in the world today. It is both widely accepted and yet still highly controversial.</p>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention poses significant challenges and raises a number of questions that give rise to an ongoing debate in regard to the current international legal framework.</p>



<p>The article considers whether humanitarian intervention is legal under international law. This is a common question but produces an undecided answer: humanitarian intervention appears to contradict the United Nations Charter, but developments in state practice since 1945might have made it legal under certain circumstances.</p>



<p>Some scholars see it as a legal right for states in some situations, whereas others argue that in all situations humanitarian intervention is an illegal act.</p>



<p>The debate suggests that humanitarian intervention is either legal or illegal depending on one’s understanding of how international law is constructed, changed, and represented.</p>



<h4><strong>Definition</strong></h4>



<p>It is difficult to construe a unifying definition of humanitarian intervention. Humanitarian intervention has been defined differently by different scholars.</p>



<p>For example, humanitarian intervention has been defined by Wil Verwey as:</p>



<p>“The threat or use of force by a state or states abroad, for the sole purpose of preventing or putting a halt to a serious violation of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to life of persons, regardless of their nationality, such protection taking place neither upon authorization by relevant organs of the United Nation no with permission by the legitimate government of the target state.”</p>



<p><strong>T.D Gill defines humanitarian intervention</strong> as, &#8220;The humanitarian intervention is the military activity by one or more States – irrespective of whether they are part of a military alliance or regional organization – aimed at putting an end to or protecting persons, not of its(their) nationality who are subjected to serious violations of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to life, without the consent of the target State and without any form of authorization by the UN Security Council&#8221;.</p>



<h4><strong>Characteristics of Humanitarian Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>Some of the essential characteristics of humanitarian intervention are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>A humanitarian intervention involves the threat and use of military forces as a central feature.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>It is an intervention in the sense that it entails interfering in the internal affairs of a state by sending military forces into the territory or airspace of a sovereign state that has not committed an act of aggression against another state.</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li>The intervention is in response to situations that do not necessarily pose direct threats to states&#8217; strategic interests but instead are motivated by humanitarian objectives.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>



<p>Getting involved in the affairs of another state on humanitarian grounds has been a subject of discussion in public international law since the 19th century.</p>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention was born out of predominantly three humanitarian catastrophes during the Nineties, namely Rwanda, Srebrenica, and Kosovo. In each of these instances, the UN was notably absent from taking action, which led to either a humanitarian crisis occurring or another body having to take action out with the law to prevent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The first catastrophe that led to the call for humanitarian intervention was the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. In the space of approximately 100 days, over half a million Tutsis were killed by the Hutu government and a further two million sought refuge in neighboring countries. This happened despite the presence of a UN peacekeeping mission, UNAMIR(United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda)on the ground. The UNAMIR, however, did not have a robust mandate and thus was not authorized to use force by the UNSC so it could do very little to prevent the attacks, especially when their numbers were actually reduced over this period.</p>



<p>Shortly after the genocide in Rwanda came a massacre of Bosnian Muslim males in Srebrenica in 1995. Because of greater fighting in the former Yugoslavia the UN created safe areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995 and the UN Protection Force was given the task of defending them. However, after Serb forces attacked the safe areas, the peacekeeping force was unable to do anything to stop it, as again UNSC had not authorized them to use force. This resulted in the killing of approximately 7,000 Muslim men. This situation, along with that of Rwanda, highlighted the real need for the international community to step up and help people in these situations, particularly if the UNSC is unable or refuses to act.</p>



<p>This is why in the case of Kosovo in 1999, the world saw a different outcome. When the UNSC refused to take any action to combat the persecution of Kosovar Albanians from the FRY(Yugoslavian army)due to continued opposition from Russia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) stepped in and began a series of aerial strikes in the name of humanitarian intervention. This action by NATO was illegal under international law as the organization did not have UNSC authorization to use force charter and it could not be classed as self-defense as a NATO member state had not been attacked. However, it was widely agreed that the intervention was ‘illegal but legitimate’ due to the humanitarian purposes it was trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Use of force</strong></h4>



<p>International law is fundamentally concerned with regulating war between states, and well-developed bodies of law exist on state conduct in war and the decision to use force.</p>



<p>In order to understand the legal basis of humanitarian intervention, it is very important to know the laws related to the use of force by states under the UN Charter. It takes two contributions that are elementary to today’s legal regime on war: it outlaws the use of force on part of individual states, and it empowers the Security Council to make all decisions on collective measures that involve military force.</p>



<ol><li>Article 2(4) establishes the first element and it requires that states not use or threaten force against other states: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This is a general prohibition, set in the section of the Charter that defines the common and fundamental obligations of UN members and of the organization itself, and it is often cited as the primary contribution of the UN system to international order. It goes along with Article2 (3), which insists that UN members settle their interstate disputes by “peaceful means.</li><li>Articles 24,39 and 42 deliver the power to use force to the Security Council. These sections of the Charter establish that the Council has the “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security” (Article 24 ) and that it can take all measures it deems necessary in that pursuit, including military action against states or other threats (Article 42 ).</li></ol>



<p>Therefore, having all these articles in the background we may conclude that the use of force is not allowed unless all other peaceful resources have been taken by states and if such recourse fails then only use of force is permitted. In other words, whether the use of force is permitted or not will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Legal basis and justification of Humanitarian intervention</strong></h4>



<p>The advocates of intervention put forward two types of arguments.&nbsp;Firstly, humanitarian intervention is directed neither at the territorial integrity nor the political independence of the targeted State and is not thus inconsistent with Art. 2(4).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the Charter is not an instrument protecting only a single value, that is peace at all costs, but it has in fact several purposes to which it gives expression. No doubt one of its fundamental values is the prohibition of the use of force, but it cannot be ignored that another is the protection of fundamental human rights. Thus, in cases of grave conflict between the maintenance of peace and respect for human rights, the proponents hold that sovereignty and non-recourse to force have to yield to humanitarian imperatives. In other words, there is a duty, at least in the most extreme cases, to strike a balance between “conflict-minimization and the protection of human rights.” Finally, a practical argument which has emotional and moral overtones and is thus, more compelling: <em>must the international community stand idly by while millions of human beings are being massacred just because in the SC a permanent member holds its protective hand over the culprit?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>UN Charter&#8217;s prohibition of use of force is not absolute </strong></h4>



<p>The use of force is only prohibited under Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter when it goes against “territorial integrity and political independence”.<sup> </sup>As a “genuine humanitarian intervention does not result in territorial conquest or political subjugation. It is a distortion to argue that [it] is prohibited by Art. 2(4).” The reference in Art. 2(4) to the “Purposes of the UN”, excludes any prohibition on humanitarian intervention as a <em>bona fide</em> humanitarian intervention is consistent with the purposes of the UN.</p>



<p>Furthermore<sup> &nbsp; </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 1(3) of the UN Charter states one of the purposes is “to achieve international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms”. As the humanitarian intervention is not contrary to these purposes, it is arguably still consistent with Art. 2(4).</p>



<p>Humanitarian intervention is permissible where the UN fails to fulfill its task of safeguarding human rights, as surely the drafters of the Charter did not intend states to merely do anything where serious human rights violations are occurring. Genocide Convention (1948) states that parties must “prevent and punish” the “crime of genocide” allows for humanitarian intervention where genocide is being committed. The ICJ opinion in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)—the Genocide Case, was “the obligation of States parties is rather to employ all means reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible”. It can be asserted using Wesley Hohfeld’s jural correlative that given the positive duty upon states to prevent genocide, which was reiterated in the Genocide Convention Case, there must be a correlative right of peoples to be protected, and in the case of genocide where there are no realistic means of exercising this right, the right to intervene must be vested in other states.</p>



<h4><strong>Interpretation of Provisions</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention<sup> </sup>provides that treaty provisions shall be interpreted in light of the treaty’s object and purpose. This is a crucial point often missed by strict constructionists. Art. 31(2) of the Vienna Convention<sup> </sup>then explains that the object and purpose of a treaty are determined, <em>inter alia</em>, by looking at the treaty’s preamble. The preamble of the UN Charter provides that its members reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person.<em> </em>In <em>Nuclear Weapons Case</em>, ICJ Judge Weeramantry noted that “dignity and worth of the human person” are keynote principles of the UN Charter.</p>



<p>Pursuant to the Vienna Convention, the provisions of the UN Charter (including Art. 2(4)’s prohibition on the use of force) must be interpreted in conformity with the purposes of the UN Charter. These purposes specifically include the promotion and protection of human rights. It is important to note that Art. 2(4) speaks of conduct inconsistent with the <em>purposes </em>of the Charter, not necessarily with the provisions of the Charter.</p>



<p>Also, the preamble of the Rome Statute acknowledges that during this century millions of children, women, and men have been victims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity and that such grave crimes threaten the peace, security, and well-being of the world.</p>



<p>Art. 2(4) cannot be interpreted to abrogate the very purposes of the Charter, especially its human rights provisions, or to deprive Articles 1, 55, 56, and the preamble of any meaning. Therefore, the article cannot be construed to prohibit <em>bona fide </em>humanitarian intervention necessary to enforce the principles of the Charter even if force is unauthorized by the SC.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>And the preamble also provides that an additional purpose of the Charter is “to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law<em> </em>can be maintained.”<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<h4><strong>Humanitarian intervention has achieved the status of&nbsp; customary international law </strong></h4>



<p>Customary international law is one component of international law. Customary international law refers to international obligations arising from established international practices, as opposed to obligations arising from formal written conventions and treaties. Customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of states that they follow from a sense of legal obligation.</p>



<p>Customary law is formed each time an international incident occurs, based on the way the international community reacts.<sup> </sup>A resolution put before the SC condemning the NATO bombing in Serbia was defeated by 12 votes to three, implying acceptance of the action as legal.<sup> </sup>This theory of the formation of new customary legal norms may well justify the Kosovo operation by way of hindsight; because nobody did anything to stop it or oppose it, then the law may have embraced it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many other precedents also which give the legal basis of humanitarian intervention and thus paving it&#8217;s way to the status of customary international law for example UK/US no-fly zone imposed over Southern Iraq from 1991 to 2003, US attack against ISIS, UK/US/France airstrikes against Syria&#8217;s chemical weapon facilities in 2018, etc. All these interventions were claimed to be done on a humanitarian basis to prevent crises. Therefore from all the above examples, we may derive that Humanitarian intervention has achieved the status of customary international law.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>The Responsibility To Protect</strong></h4>



<p>The norm of non-intervention must give way when a State commits genocide or crimes against humanity on its own territory. This approach was first reflected in a report by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (‘ICISS’). ICISS was created after the Kosovo intervention under the support of the Canadian government and a group of private foundations in response to appeals by Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, produced a detailed Report<sup> </sup>on humanitarian intervention entitled “The Responsibility to Protect”. The Commission recognized that the responsibility to protect its people from killing and other grave harm was the most basic and fundamental of all the responsibilities that sovereignty imposes—and pursuant to this doctrine if a state cannot or will not protect its people from such harm, then coercive intervention for human protection purposes, including ultimately military intervention, by others in the international community may be justified in extreme cases.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>The Commission then goes on to state the conditions under which the interests of protection prevail. For an intervention to be lawful there must be:</p>



<ol><li>a just cause;</li><li>the right intention (<em>recta intention</em>);&nbsp;</li><li>a situation of last recourse (<em>ultima ratio</em>);&nbsp;</li><li>respect for the principle of proportionality;&nbsp;</li><li>reasonable prospects of success;&nbsp;</li><li>a prior request for authorization by the SC of the action.</li></ol>



<p>For the just cause (a.), it is clearly stated that only a grave and irreparable harm for human beings, i.e. considerable losses of human lives (actual or expected) or ethnic cleansing on a large scale can give rise to a right of military intervention.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>As for the “right intention” (b.), the Commission stresses that the essential aim of the intervention must be to halt or avert human suffering<em>.</em><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Further, the intervention must be the last recourse (c.), i.e. all diplomatic and other non-military means must previously have been explored. It is not necessary for all ways to have been actually tried and proved unsuccessful; it is, however, necessary to establish there were reasonable grounds for believing that, in the circumstances, the measure, if attempted, would not have been successful, e.g., by reason of lack of time.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Moreover, the intervention must be proportionate (d.) in scope, duration, and intensity to the humanitarian aim pursued, which means that the force used must be the minimum necessary to accomplish the aim.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Finally, the criterion of reasonable prospects of success of the operation (e.) requires there must be a reasonable chance of success in halting or averting the suffering which has justified the intervention, with the consequences of action not likely to be worse than the consequences of inaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore whether there was a bonafide humanitarian intervention or not must be checked out under the above references.</p>



<p>Besides as already mentioned, the preamble of the UN Charter also provides that an additional purpose of the Charter is “to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.” The Responsibility to Protect the norm, which is one of those other sources, holds that states have a fundamental duty to protect their people from serious and systematic human rights abuses. The GA, offering strong evidence of opinion Juris, explained, “Each individual state has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity through appropriate and necessary means and, if a state cannot or will not prevent the occurrence of such abuses, then the intervention by other actors in the international community is justified.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention is very important. Although a group of propounders does not consider it legal to intervene in the affairs of other states there is enough legal basis, as explained above to justify humanitarian intervention. How can a part of the world ignore all the atrocities and human killings and violations in some other part of the world, turn its back, and live a luxurious life? It is against the basic moral character of humans to let a population in some people of the world die on their own just because international law is not expressly allowing it.</p>



<p>The need of the hour is that the UN should expressly provide some laws to authorize humanitarian intervention in the parts of the world where it is gravely needed. Until then the world should take recourse to the broad interpretation of the UN Charter and Customary International law to intervene in other states on humanitarian grounds to prevent and protect human atrocities in any part of the world.</p>



<p>But at the same time, it has to be taken care of that any superpower or developed state should not intervene in an underdeveloped State for their own benefits and agendas on the pretext of humanitarian intervention.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>In India, no doubt there are special laws relating to children but still, they are deprived of even basic human rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of India and other legislation. In India, the problem of child labour is quite alarming. As per Census 2011, the total child population in India in the age group (5-14) years is 259.6 million. Of these, 10.1 million (3.9% of total child population) are working, either as ‘main worker’ or as ‘marginal worker’. In addition, more than 42.7 million children in India are out of school. [i]</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Child labour deprives the child of an opportunity for education, play, and recreation. It affects physical growth, normal development, and prevents their preparation for responsibility. There are a number of risks that are experienced by working children. The worst effect of child labour is that it interferes with the education of the children which decreases their vocational development. They neither acquire any skill nor receive any education as a result they remain illiterate and oppressed. Most of all it gives birth to a number of economic problems such as the use of labour at its lowest productivity implying thereby an inefficient utilization of labor-power.</p>



<p>The most affected aspect of working children is their health. The working children are more vulnerable to tuberculosis and bronchitis, muscle atrophy, weakening and malformation of bones, eye diseases, stunted growth, finger arthritis, damage to fingernails, and malnutrition.</p>



<p>The worst forms of child labour which include slavery and similar practices like trafficking, forced labour, etc. have severe effects on children like depression, premature aging, malnutrition, and drug dependency. It endangers the child‘s dignity and morals. It endangers their innocence.</p>



<h4><strong>Constitutional Safeguards in India for Children</strong></h4>



<p>Keeping in view the gigantic problem of child labour, the Indian Parliament enacted appropriate laws for protecting children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is, in a way, likely to be hazardous or harmful to their health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. The Constitution of India has enough provisions in this regard.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Article 15(3)</strong> of the Constitution authorizes the state for making any special provision for women and children. </li><li><strong>Article 21 </strong>provides, no person shall be deprived of his life or his personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. </li><li><strong>Article 21A</strong> says the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6-14 years in such manners as the State may, by law, determine. </li><li><strong>Article 23</strong> says traffic in human beings and the beggar and other forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this position shall be an offense punishable in accordance with the law. </li><li>Under <strong>Article 24</strong> no child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. </li><li><strong>Article 39(E)</strong> says the State shall make its policy towards securing the health and strengths and the tender age of children are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength. Article 39 (E) enjoins that childhood and youth are to be protected against exploitation, against moral and material abandonment. </li><li>In <strong>Article 45</strong> the Constitution provides free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years. </li><li>The general provisions under<strong> Article 38, 42, 43, 45, and 47 of Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>, although do not deal directly with child welfare but provide a strategy for indirectly promoting the welfare of children.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Legislative Provisions for Protection of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Notwithstanding the abovementioned constitutional provisions, there are a number of enactments in the country which protect and safeguard the interests of child labour.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Factories Act of 1881</strong> was the first law to define children and to prescribe prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 7 years of age. The Factories Act, 1911 prohibited employment of children in dangerous occupations and working during night hours. The first Convention of International Labour Organisation (ILO), compelled amendment of the Act in 1922, to raise the minimum age of a child to 15 years. However, children below the age of 12 years were prohibited from employment. The age rose to 13 years in 1935 under the Act. </li><li><strong>The Factories Act, 1948</strong>, prescribes prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 14 years of age in any factory. </li><li><strong>India Mines Act, 1952 </strong>prohibits employment of children below 16 years in any underground mines.</li><li><strong>Plantation Labour Act, 1951 </strong>prohibits employment less than the age of 12 years<strong>. </strong></li><li><strong>The Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961 </strong>absolutely prohibits the employment of children in motor transport. </li><li><strong>The Shops and Commercial Establishments Acts of different States, </strong>also prohibit employment of children in the shops, hotels, dhabas, street shops, and commercial places. </li><li><strong>Besides the above legislations, The Apprentice Act, 1961, </strong>The Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966, The Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 provide that employment of children is a punishable offense. </li></ul>



<p>As required by ILO Convention and as envisaged in the National Seminar on Employment of Children in 1975, to prevent exploitation of children, the Indian Government felt to enact a single Act to deal with the prohibition of child labour.</p>



<h4><strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act</strong></h4>



<p>To provide uniformity of age and to prescribe stricter punishments, the Indian Parliament enacted a single Act to deal with the exploitation of children,<em> i.e.</em>, <strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986</strong>. The Act prohibited the employment of children below the age of 14 years in certain occupations and processes. These include the transport of passengers, goods, and mails and other hazardous work in railways and ports, the process like Beedi making, cement manufacturing, manufacturing of matches and explosives, mica cutting, soap manufacturing, wool cleaning, and building and construction industries. The Act also provides for regulations of conditions of work by prescribing minimum working hours, prohibiting work at night, prohibiting overtime work, and weekly holiday. Also, the Act provides measures for the health and safety of child workers. It emphasized the maintenance of a register having details of children if employed by any organization. Indirect support was extended for such an evil practice which should be totally prohibited irrespective of the nature of employment. <strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012</strong>, has several features that are child-centered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Act tried to fill the gaps which existed due to earlier Acts. However, this Act also proved to be ineffective in curbing the problem. As per UNICEF (2011), the number of child labourers in India is 10.1 million of which 5.6 million are boys and 4.5 million are girls [ii]. Thus, with modernization, the Government of India tried to keep pace with changing times where child labour has included many other forms of exploitation and the government brought an amendment in 2016 which brought many changes in the Act. Some major changes were –</p>



<ul><li>While the original act allowed the employment of children above 14 years in hazardous occupations and processes, the Amendment banned the employment of children at such places up to the age of 18 years.</li><li>The Amendment calls for stricter punishments for violations.</li><li>While the Act prohibited the employment of children up to 14 years in specified categories such as domestic work, automobile workshops, and other hazardous industries; the Amendment gives certain exceptions where the children of such age are allowed to work, like in sporting activities but only in non-school hours and without a subordinate relationship of work and labour. The government justified the exceptions to strike a balance between the need for education for children and the reality of the socio-economic condition and social fabric in the country. But, this Amendment was criticized for taking away the basic protections for some of the most vulnerable workers, and some well-known child rights activists while criticizing the new Amendment say that it permits children to be confined to work instead of being in school because allowing children to work before and after school creates an imbalance in their lives and the children cannot be expected to do multi-tasks at such a tender age and as a result, they are forced to give up their education.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>C</strong>hallenges</h4>



<p>Despite such legislation and rights guaranteed by the Constitution, India continues to be among the countries which have the highest percentage of child labour. The main reasons for this are the economic condition of India, the imbalance that exists in its societies, and most of all the weak implementation mechanisms. In addition to these reasons are, namely:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Poverty &#8211;</strong> It is the single important reason for child labour. The poor parents in order to supplement their income allow the children to work even on unremunerative jobs. Abject poverty and unemployment force the children to take up unremunerative jobs. Thus, economic compulsions weigh heavily on the consciousness of the poor parents and they would not mind colluding with their children’s employers in violating the laws and putting their children under the risks of inhuman exploitation. Parents want their children to earn for themselves as early as possible, much better, if they become a source of income to the family. </li></ul>



<p>Even the highest court of the country has observed that the child labour in India is purely on account of economic reasons that the parents often want their children to be employed to augment their meager earnings and this problem cannot be solved by mere legislation because of the poverty and destitution in the country. In order to eradicate this problem, it is essential that a child should have been able to receive proper education with a view to equipping itself to become a useful member of society and to play a constructive role in the socio-economic development of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Loss of an earning member of the family.</li><li>The poor conviction rate of the violators.</li><li>Many employers prefer to engage children because they are cheap. Moreover, children tend to be less troublesome, more disciplined, and highly adaptable.</li><li>Absence of any state-sponsored scheme of family allowance.</li><li>Nonexistence of any general scheme of compulsory education up to a minimum age.</li><li>The evasion of existing laws for the protection of children.</li><li>Even the social structure system is responsible for child labour as the social structure is characterized by the caste system. The members of the low castes and down-trodden communities are expected to be for the services of the upper castes and thus, they are deprived of their aspirations.</li></ul>



<p>The problem of child labour in India is deeply rooted in the exploitative socio-economic set-up and poor and backward economy. Ignorance by people, lack of opportunities, and other socio-economic institutions add to this problem.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>No doubt there are a number of legislations and constitutional safeguards for child welfare to overcome child labour and to avoid the situations that come as a consequence of child labour. At an international level, different organizations are also working for the same cause. But still, there are a lot of efforts needed to create an environment that is free from child abuse. The instances discussed in the various sections of the writing indicate how far India is in eradicating child labour and how hard work it needs to do for the welfare of the poor, ignorant, and unheard children. The problem lies in the implementation side. The States should devise effective mechanisms for the proper implementation of laws. The more responsibility lies on the parents who should not force their children to indulge in such occupations. Awareness building programs shall be conducted with parents and communities through which people at large can understand the ill-effects of child labour. This problem needs the support of every person in the society and we should discourage the people to employ children in factories, homes, shops, etc. and the initiatives of the civil societies also need to be appreciated.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Gulf countries or the “Arabian Gulf” is a group of Arab states that border the Persian Gulf or, in simple terms it is often understood as the group of ‘oil-producing states’ surrounding the Persian Gulf which is a shallow marginal sea in the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Peninsula and southeastern Iran. It is a set of seven countries namely:</p>



<ol><li>Bahrain</li><li>Iraq</li><li>Kuwait</li><li>Oman</li><li>Qatar</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>United Arab Emirates<br>All these countries, except Iraq, are members of the Gulf Cooperation Committee (GCC), a regional intergovernmental organization to foster economic, scientific, and business cooperation among the member countries, and have a lot of things in common, for example, their food styles, values, cultures, etc. However, the main difference lies in their political structures. These countries form some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, mostly due to a boom in oil, natural gas, and petroleum revenues. They also dominate other OPEC ( The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries in oil production and are among the wealthiest countries of the world, on a per capita basis.</li></ol>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="384" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Q9gBDFcL5KOdhTYwf0rHdNDPaYpE5XK9MSCLeQxUKoM5-KawRCw8GQaXZx67lPgD6LdNOylIpoLpjVaizFHr5pcibQX0fs5Aunir8pe36PnXTZ0MbZ4pkB4EQmx62l4U5Ygs-A"></p>



<p><em>According to current estimates, 79.4% of the world&#8217;s proven oil reserves are located in OPEC Member Countries, with the bulk of OPEC oil reserves in the Middle East, amounting to 64.5% of the OPEC total.</em></p>



<h4><strong>A Brief History</strong></h4>



<p>“Discovery of oil” in the Gulf is what has shaped all the affairs of the region, be it history, economy, or polity. In the Gulf region, oil was first found in 1927 in northern Iraq, followed by Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and others over the years.<br>However, considering the importance and the value of the resource that was found there, the greed (amongst the Gulf countries) to take control over all oil reserves and to rule the world, lead to a number of wars, which ultimately resulted in the western intervention in their affairs and left some serious long-term implications on their internal structures, leading to the instability that is witnessed today.<br>• <strong>The Iran-Iraq War</strong></p>



<p>The roots of the Iran- Iraq War (1980-88) lay in a number of territorial and political disputes between Iraq and Iran. However, mainly Iraq wanted to seize control of the rich oil-producing Iranian border region of Khūzestān, a territory inhabited largely by ethnic Arabs. In September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded through a broad front into Khūzestān and captured the city of Khorramshahr but failed to take the important oil-refining center of Ābādān. Iran’s counterattacks began to compel the Iraqis to give ground in 1981. Later in the year 1982, Iraq voluntarily withdrew its forces from all captured Iranian territory and began seeking a peace agreement with Iran. However, the violence continued while both the nations still engaged in sporadic air and missile attacks against each other’s cities and military and oil installations. They also attacked each other’s oil-tanker shipping in the Persian Gulf. The Iran-Iraq war finally ended in 1988 only after the United Nations-brokered a ceasefire.<br>• <strong>The Gulf War</strong></p>



<p>In August 1990, Iraq invaded the country of Kuwait to its southeast in a bid to gain more control over the lucrative oil supply of the Middle East. Alarmed by these actions, fellow Arab powers such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt called on the United States and other Western nations to intervene. The then Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein defied United Nations Security Council&#8217;s demands to withdraw from Kuwait by mid-January 1991, and the Persian Gulf War began with a massive U.S.-led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm. After 42 days of relentless attacks by the allied coalition in the air and on the ground, the then U.S. President George H.W. Bush declared a cease-fire on February 28, 1991; by that time, most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled. Although, as a result of this war Kuwait was liberated, before leaving Iraqi soldiers set fire to about 500 oil wells and dumped millions of gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf, leading to an environmental crisis.</p>

<p>The end of the Gulf war did not, however, mark the end of the involvement of the United States in the Middle East, rather, towards the end of the twentieth century, the foreign policy of the United States and other western nations became more and more netted in the politics of the Gulf.</p>



<h4><strong>The Western Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>The Western intervention in the Middle East started after the end of World War I (WWI) and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. When the allies won WWI, the Middle East was divided between Britain and France according to their own interests rather than those of the ethnic groups of the region. After World War II (WWII), they did not continue in the Gulf and left, but the borders they had created remained. However, after WWII, the US started its involvement when it started to see its interests in the region. Using terrorism as a tactic and growth of OPEC and the use of oil in political ways, it began intervening in the affairs of the Gulf. The presence of oil in the region also found Britain, France, the European Union (EU), and other Western allies carving their ways into the Gulf. As already mentioned, the Gulf War gave the most sought after opportunity to the Western forces to lay their foot on the Arabian soil and shape its internal structures in every manner to support their interests.</p>



<p><strong>Iraq:</strong> On September 11, 2001, an Islamic terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, attacked the World Trade Centre in New York resulting in the killing of thousands of civilians. The US accused Iraq of supplying weapons of mass destruction to Al-Qaeda and on the pretext of seizing those weapons, the US and the allied forces attacked and occupied the Iraqi land in 2003, at the cost of savage bloodshed and mass destruction. The country came under full western control, there were armed forces bases set up, air force patrolling, etc. The US kept building up its strength in Iraq over the years to tens of thousands of soldiers until the end of 2011 when it finally started to withdraw because it did not find any strong evidence to support its claim. The role played by America and Britain post-2003 resulted in a feeling of anger and distress among Iraqis and led fundamentalist organizations to flourish, especially the Islamic State of Iraq. As a result, the US redeployed its forces in Iraq and tried to legitimize its presence in the region on various pretexts, such as protecting US officials and facilities in Iraq, helping the natives to defend themselves, and preventing a possible genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.</p>



<p>Besides Iraq, Western presence has been profound in Yemen, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and UAE as well. “Arab Spring”, which was a series of anti-governmental uprisings in the Arab world in response to the oppressive regimes and low standards of living, paved a way for the Western forces, especially the US, to further its influence in the Gulf countries like Yemen and Bahrain, apart from other Middle-East countries. The slogans which dominated the uprising were <strong>“liberty”, “dignity”, “jobs” </strong>and an<strong> “end to corruption”</strong>. The West apparently identified with these slogans and felt it was on the same side with protesters. But, it had its own interests as well &#8211; the European Union (EU) wanted to stop the Arab migration, which is viewed as a potential source of social tension, into the EU. The US had its strategic interests in the region as it is a vital global energy resource. Besides, the area was of strategic military importance for the US, France, and Britain. The US has installed some of its major army camps in Kuwait (Arifjanin and Buehring camps) and Qatar(Aaliyah camp). Besides, the US air force also maintains installations in Kuwait, UAE, and Qatar along with navy deployments in the region. Apart from this, thousands of troops have been deployed in various states across the Gulf region. It maintains stationing of several dozen personnel in Oman as well.<br>Further, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> has maintained a close relationship with the United States since its inception, given that it was the chief country that called for Western interference in the first place(during the Gulf War). The Saudi-US relations stem from the economics of oil because Saudi holds about a quarter of the world’s known oil reserves. However, some say that it is US hypocrisy because Saudi is a monarchy and its very setup is the antithesis to democracy but the US is still maintaining its ties. The US has been staying back in Saudi, saying it is concerned about the latter’s security, even though there is no formal defense agreement between the two countries. Since the 1990&#8217;s the US has been deploying tens of thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia for its defense against Iraq, and also providing ammunition as well as military training to its army. It also claims to have undertaken several counter-terrorism operations in the region along with the Saudi regime. Even though in recent times the relations of the two have not been really good, but, the military alliance between the two continues. In March 2015, President Barack Obama even declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a &#8220;Joint Planning Cell&#8221; with Saudi Arabia.</p>



<h4><strong>Consequences of Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>Ensuring the free flow of oil represents perhaps the most constant US interest in the Middle East. Europe, China, and Japan all also depend on oil imports for their energy needs. Therefore, since at least the 1970s, America’s key strategic interests in the region have involved not only securing easy access for itself but also guaranteeing an open and secure market for Japan and Europe. No doubt, the presence of Western agencies has had some positive influences on the otherwise non-democratic and non-liberal Gulf regimes and it has to a very great extent helped in the development of these countries as well. However, the fact remains, that intervention in any country&#8217;s internal affairs beyond a particular level becomes undesirable and produces contravening and destabilizing effects on that country. Similarly, years of Western intervention in the Gulf has left its ill impacts on the region on various fronts. </p>



<p><strong>Given under are some of the unfortunate effects of Western Intervention in various Gulf regions:</strong><br>• The continuous presence and intervention of the US in Iraq have had grave results on all fronts, be it humanitarian, political, economic, or cultural. Ever since 2003, millions of people have been displaced, thousands killed, nearly one-third of the population living in poverty, making it one of the biggest catastrophes of the world. The US with its entry also gave a blow to the state-owned factories and enterprises by introducing foreign investments and gradually resulted in an unprecedented increase in unemployment of the natives. Further, it also destroyed the cultural heritage of Iraq with its art museums and other important cultural institutions being damaged during the early occupation. Also, the Western presence was supposed to bring about a democratic reform but, even today, democracy remains a dream. Instead, it has increased terrorism and sectarian violence and also increased competition and rivalries amongst various regional actors. Thus, as far as Iraq is concerned, an intervention (from the West) which was justified on humanitarian grounds, resulted in a grossly negative impact and distorted its entire structure, while not even serving altogether fruitful for the US as well, as it also suffered huge loss over the years while engaging in various warfares in Iraq.</p>



<p>• Even though there has been no direct uprising against the presence of the US in Arab, but, there has been growing resentment among the masses against it. In such circumstances, supporting the Western presence by some Arab nations has resulted in an ever-developing feeling of humiliation and a strong sense of loss in the populace. Western presence has also been used by terrorist organizations to radicalize young men. This sentiment if not addressed seriously can result in further unrest in the region and may even result in a popular revolt, destroying the social, political, and economical structure very badly.<br>• As a <strong>result of the intervention</strong>, just like in Iraq, inherent tribal, sectarian, and ethnic conflicts in other countries also have intensified. Further, it has resulted in pressure upon the Arab world from two opposite directions, one, the originally Islamic Fundamentalist ideology, and two, the ‘’ democracy’’ and ‘’freedom’’ ideas promoted by Western powers.</p>



<p>• <strong>According to the United Nations</strong>, as a result of the Saudi led airstrikes in Yemen (which is in a state of war over the transition of power), 7,700 civilian deaths have taken place till March 2020, and currently Yemen is experiencing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. In doing so, the coalition has received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK, and France.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="636" height="369" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UcFIRaa05DeyNvIJvYEa0QTfgDF9prmvOBWKnRZr_K9jmiCVdh7UkTIUWekeng22b2cWQXLanH-J8YYq4XYjV1ReqRJAcPKHgSZJCJvoEi2Xu3uB7GdQOhVkZxLU4Io-84nkeg"></p>



<p><em>More than 60% of civilian deaths have been the result of Saudi-led airstrikes, the UN says [EPA]</em></p>



<p>• In <strong>Bahrain</strong>, where there was an uprising, mainly sectarian, to overthrow the existing regime in 2014, the US, along with Saudi again, cracked down upon the people seeking their rights. It adopted a policy of blanketing Manama, the capital of Bahrain, and surrounding villages with tanks and armored personnel carriers, using live ammunition as well as tear gas and rubber bullets to break up demonstrations. Even though the uprising was in its favor as it encouraged the ‘democratic sentiment’ but, it suppressed it forcefully in order to secure its larger interest, that is, its relations with Saudi Arabia. Therefore, it can be said that on one hand, the west pretends to maintain the presence of authoritarian regimes as far as it serves its interest. On the other, it prefers to pretend as if it upholds the principle of democracy by popular voices and choices in the Arab world.<br>International intervention is a common phenomenon in international relations. In the modern era of globalization and technological development, intervention by various international actors such as the United Nations and other international organizations are somewhat indispensable in order to bring about coordination in the international community and also to ensure equality and justice at the global level. However, intervention is of two types, “power intervention” and “well-intentioned intervention”. Power intervention means “interference” in the affairs of another country, whereas, well-intentioned intervention is intervening with a positive approach. The intervention thus, must with an intention to help the region to progress and to diffuse the long-existing crisis and must be up to a certain level. But, the Western intervention in the Gulf has been ‘power intervention’. At the international level, the sovereignty of a nation is the most sacred principle, respecting the authority and supremacy of a nation with respect to its internal affairs is the obligation of every other nation. Intervening to a point where it infringes the sovereignty of that country is condemnable and produces most often, devastating results, as can be witnessed in the Gulf today. A region that was supposed to be so well developed and rich is reeling under an unprecedented conflict and humanitarian crisis, as a result of years of uncontrolled Western intervention. Therefore, the international community must unite and call upon the West to withdraw from the Gulf and help it rejuvenate its culture, economy, polity, and ultimately bring about stability.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with an area of 2.3m sq/km, is a giant of sub-Saharan Africa, bordered by nine other countries. DRC was formerly referred to as Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-Leopoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire. It is the 2nd largest country in the African Continent after Algeria and the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa with Kinshasa it&#8217;s Capital. It has been divided into 26 provinces.<br>The country has enormous mineral wealth – copper, diamond, gold, cobalt, etc., and potentially large reserves of oil and natural gas. Paradoxically, this resource-rich country is also the site of one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The conflicts of 1996 and 1998 have resulted in massive disruption of the social, political, and economic fabric of the country. For over a decade the country has been mired in conflict with devastating effects on its civilian population. Though the parties involved within the conflict have their perspective regarding the cause and course of the conflict, nobody can deny that the region is in dire need of peace as well as sustainable development to break the ‘conflict trap’ that has brought miseries for all the conflict-ridden countries of the world including the ones in the African continent.<br>The costs of the conflict are self-evident. Besides death and destruction, large-scale displacement is an integral part of the conflict. Other humanitarian costs include a negative impact on women and other vulnerable groups, and there has been a noticeable increase in post-trauma stress syndrome and the resultant psychiatric problems for the victims. The economic costs of the conflict cannot be confined to a particular sector of industry or investment prospects. It has affected the important sources of livelihood of the local people.</p>



<h4><strong>Colonization and Independence</strong></h4>



<p>The colonization in DRC started in 1870 by King Leopold II of Belgium with the exploitation of natural resources, forced labor, mass killings, and widespread slave labor through his harsh rule for almost 90 years. The country witnessed brutal colonization following a hue and cry internationally. In 1908, the Belgian parliament took over the Free State from Leopold following international pressure, and then it became the Belgian Congo, under the rule of the elected Belgian government.<br>Patrice Lumumba was elected the First Prime Minister of the DRC in May 1960. But after a few months, the PM was overthrown by a military group led by Joseph Desire Mobutu with the help from the US and Belgium and was later assassinated in 1961<br>Joseph Mobutu after overthrowing the PM Lumumba started a dictatorship for almost 36 years, and during this period he renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko and renamed the country Zaire and the country was known as Zaire from 1971 to 1997.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin of Crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo</strong></h4>



<p><strong>• The Mobutu Era and First Congo Conflict</strong></p>



<p>During the tenure of Joseph Mobutu, a one-party system was established wherein elections were held periodically, with the incumbent head of the state as the only candidate. Mobutu was guilty of severe human rights violations and political repression. Corruption was integral to the system, and politicians became entirely dependent on Mobutu’s goodwill. He consolidated power by co-opting potential rivals and exploited the country’s vast natural resources. By the 1990s, the country’s economy was near collapse due to mismanagement, corruption, and authoritarianism. This overall dismal scenario and the later happenings in the DRC gave credibility to the stance that conflicts in Africa, including the one in the DRC, are due to ‘bad governance’.</p>



<p>Bad governance within the state accompanied by the external dimension, i.e. the Rwandan genocide of 1994 laid the foundation of conflict in the DRC. Some of the militias responsible for killing thousands of Tutsis in Rwanda fled across the border to the DRC. This provoked Rwanda and Uganda to invade the Congo and finally, they invaded the DRC in July 1996.<br>The Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo (AFDL) under the leadership of Laurent Kabila and backed by Rwanda and Uganda ousted Mobutu in May 1997. The ascendancy of Kabila led to the end of the first conflict, and the name of the country was restored to the DRC.</p>



<p>• <strong>Kabila Regime and the Second Congo Conflict</strong></p>



<p>Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of the exploitation of resources and with the help of many countries, overthrew Rwanda and Uganda out of DRC. The Lusaka ceasefire agreement (July 1999) and deployment of the UN peacekeeping force in 2000 attempted to end the hostilities between nations. However, the violence continued in DRC from 1998 to 2003. Rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda fought Government forces supported by Angola Namibia attacked back resulting in the second Congo war. In addition to this, there was also a proxy war which continued till 2008 between Rwanda and Uganda.</p>



<h4><strong>Peace and Democratic Attempts</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>Consequences of the Crisis</strong>:</h4>



<p><strong>• Killings and Displacement</strong></p>



<p>The people of the DRC have suffered immensely throughout colonial times and in the post-independence era. The continuation of an exploitative colonial legacy by the leaders of the independent DRC brought a trail of death, destruction, and underdevelopment for the people. The ongoing conflicts have aggravated the situation. It has claimed numerous lives and plunged the resource-rich country into chaos and acute underdevelopment.</p>

<p><em>12 year old amputee Kakule Elie, hit by a stray bullet, lies in a bed in a hospital in Goma in 2012</em></p>



<p>The United Nations in 2005 described the crisis in Eastern Congo, as the ‘world’s worst humanitarian crisis.’ Since 2000, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has documented the humanitarian impact of conflict through mortality surveys. The first four studies, conducted by IRC, estimated that 3.9 million people had died since 1998. About 10 percent of all the deaths were due to violence and 90 percent were due to diseases like malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition. The fifth survey concluded that 5.4 million deaths have occurred between 1998 and 2007, with as many as 45,000 people dying every month. As with previous IRC studies in the DRC, the majority of deaths have been due to infectious diseases, malnutrition, and maternity-related problems. In 2007, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs put the figures of internally displaced persons at 1.16 million. The UNHCR put the figures for Congolese refugees in the neighboring countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda at 310,000. A Human Rights Watch report has accused DRC‘s neighboring countries of committing abuses both economically as well as physically.</p>

<p><em>The M23 group is fighting the DRC military for control of the country, and the violence is driving tens of thousands of Congolese out of their homes.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Impact of Crisis on Women and Children</strong></h4>



<p>The most vulnerable to the Congo crisis are women and children. Displacement increases women’s risk of sexual violence. Many children lose access to education. While the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) works to integrate all displaced children within the DRC into a national education system, many of the schools still lack the resources necessary to effectively support the staff and students. UNHRC is on the ground providing life-saving humanitarian support to millions of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees in the DRC.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Word\women.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r1XZZxvUrGfo8-A2wu86wj6Q9QvK_Cz0ZW0YytKvIwyWFnGUgmGj6vvcdjrt22PDMYUiljuIzshehkiKGsVdN2S7BXb-9nv5JFdC-p-ByDaLQkQGjWVC9QJ7hNA6ge-HQvy9Cg" width="488" height="277"></p>



<p><em>A displaced Congolese woman carries her belongings as she enters a United Nations base in Monigi, 5 Km from Goma in 2012.</em></p>



<p>According to Jeanie Bandu Bahati (coordinator of an organization that promoted development, gender, and peace) held that there is a catastrophic and chaotic situation in DRC with women and girls confronted by permanent displacement, massacres, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, house burning, etc.<br>According to a report by the International Rescue Committee, since the end of the 1st war in DRC in 1998, at least 5.4 million people have died. Due to hunger, diseases, violence, and displacement every month 45000 Congolese die (half of them are children).<br>Eastern Congo is the world’s worst place for women. Rape in Congo exists on a scale seen nowhere in the world is used as a weapon of war. Rape as a weapon of war had destroyed women, families, and communities.<br>The United Nations peace-keeping forces have been accused of adding to the woes of the people. According to a 2007 report of the Human Rights Watch from December 2004 to August 2006, around 140 allegations of sexual exploitation involving United Nations personnel were recorded in Congo.</p>



<p>• <strong>Economic Implications</strong></p>



<p>The conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue and increased external debt. Foreign business houses have curtailed operations due to an uncertain atmosphere, lack of infrastructure, and a non-conducive and difficult work environment. There has been an increase in unemployment. A country rich in natural resources has become one of the least developed countries. The infrastructure in terms of road density, electrification, and water supply remains poor. The country is the world’s largest producer of cobalt and a major producer of copper and diamond but the resources of the country have been a curse and brought misfortunes for the natives and all the benefits have gone to the outsiders. Resources have been used to fuel conflict and not to get people out of poverty. In 2007, the Human Development Index ranked the country at 168 positions out of a total of 177 countries.</p>



<p>The unstable situation has provided a fertile ground for the stakeholders to exploit the natural wealth of DRC with impunity. A United Nations report published in April 2001 pointed out that all the parties involved in the conflict profited by looting resources of DRC. The overall situation hence remains fragile and poverty is all-pervasive.<br>The DRC is emerging from a decade of political instability and violent conflict that has led to the near-collapse of the economy and caused the annual per capita income to plummet to $120 in 2005 (down from $380 in 1985). Experts have described this as ‘development in reverse.’ The country has the second-largest swath of rainforests in the world. With 86 million hectares of the area covered by rainforests, the DRC accounts for over half of the total remaining rainforests in the Central Africa region. Congo forests are a vital resource, both for the Congolese people and the global environment. About 40 million Congolese depend on the forests for their food, income, energy, shelter, medicines, and cultural needs. Described as the ‘second lung’ of the planet for their ability to store carbon dioxide on a global scale, these Congolese forests too have been threatened by widespread poverty and instability in the region.</p>



<h4><strong>International Response</strong></h4>



<p>The UN and various International communities have been greatly involved in seeking a resolution to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) conflict, specifically in the past decade.</p>



<p><strong>• Human Rights Council (HRC)</strong></p>



<p>In the HRC Report 2012, the HRC referenced Resolution 19/27, which was adopted in March 2012. The resolution encouraged the establishment of a national Human Rights Commission in the DRC and asked the High Commissioner of Human Rights to submit a report in 2013.</p>



<p><strong>I. United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)</strong></p>



<p>In October 2010, the OHCHR released a report on the DRC entitled “DRC: Mapping Human Rights Violations 1993-2003”. The report notes the serious incidents of Human Rights abuses. OHCHR also addressed the issue of sexual violence in its 2011 report entitled “Remedies and Reparations for Victims of Sexual Violence in DRC”. The report highlighted how victims of sexual violence are often responsible for bearing the cost of harm done to them and asked the Congolese Government to implement a reparations fund for victims of sexual violence.</p>



<p><strong>• International Criminal Court (ICC)</strong></p>



<p>In 2004, the then-president of DRC (Kabila) referred his country to the ICC and the former ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo formally announced his decision to open the first-ever ICC investigation into the crimes committed in the DRC.<br>In 2012, former Leader of the Union Des Patriotes Congolais (UPC), Thomas Lubanga, was convicted of war crimes and child soldiers and was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in jail.</p>



<p>• United Nations Security Council (UNSCThe most crucial element of the UNSC’s intervention in the DRC has been its authorization of two missions to the country. First is the United Nations Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) that was established in 1999 following the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. MONUC was succeeded in 2010 by United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO), aimed to better protect civilians and address issues that were raised during the MONUC period, including the sexual abuse by United Nations Peacekeepers.</p>



<h4><strong>Regional Response</strong></h4>



<p><strong>I. Southern African Development Community (SADC</strong>)</p>



<p>In 2008, the members of SADC (heads of state) agreed to immediately deploy a team of military experts to assess the escalating violence in the country, as well as an additional team to evaluate the situation on the ground.</p>



<p>• <strong>International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the February 2013 Framework Agreement</strong></p>



<p>Congolese President Kabila used the ICGLR as a platform for discussion by convening a series of meetings. The Peace Agreement that was signed in 2013 by Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the DRC, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia was negotiated by UNSC with ICGLR. The Agreement emphasized issues of sexual violence and displacement, among other Human Rights abuses, and noted that progress begins with the cessation of violence.<br>At the country level, the DRC agreed to work towards decentralization and further structural form. Regional players promised to respect not only one another’s sovereignty but to also increase cooperation between states.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The political situation in the DRC is bad. The extreme violence in the country is from the very beginning but the violence in the country exacerbated due to the failure of holding the presidential election constitutionally. The governance problems have an immediate impact on the humanitarian situation. Ultimately, the spirit of democracy not guns must rule the DRC, and improvements in governance should be the primary focus of all the local, regional as well as international actors in their efforts to help the long-suffering people. To avoid the return of the conflict the reconstruction process has to accompany initiatives to control violence. The DRC needs global assistance to make a speedy economic recovery and to ensure that the fruits of the development are distributed equitably. There is an urgent need to address the disparities among different communities that inhabit the country and promote democracy and the rule of law, which can combat corruption and promote good governance. Without an integrated approach that involves national and international institutions, the return to chaos is imminent as shallow peace may not be sustainable. The continued and genuine efforts by local, national, and international actors that work in tandem can be the only way out for the country to experience genuine democracy and prevent a return to chaos.</p>



<p>The Government of DRC to create a conducive climate for dialogue must ensure that human rights and rule of law will be respected and the justice system will be ceased as a political tool. The political prisoners at the first instance should be released and the persons subjected to harsh violence to be rehabilitated.<br>The persons who have been forced to flee to different areas must be provided with humanitarian assistance and ways must be carved out to end this conflict which is in DRC for years now. The humanitarian condition of women in the country can be described as degrading and chaotic. The condition of women folk has worsened in the last two decades. There needs a revision of protection, security, socio-economic and political factors to uplift the condition of women and children in DRC.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“<em>There are people in the world so hungry, that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>-Mahatma Gandhi</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>South Sudan, officially referred to as the Republic of South Sudan is a landlocked country in East-Central Africa. It got independence in 2011 from the Republic of Sudan, emerging as becoming the world’s newest country. After almost nine years of gaining independence, South Sudan should be a country full of hope and new possibilities, but instead, it is in the grip of a massive humanitarian crisis.</p>



<p>Political conflict, ecological imbalance compounded by economic woes and drought, has caused massive displacement, raging violence, and dire food shortage. The ongoing conflict and insecurity have pushed millions to the brink of starvation for years. In 2017, famine or near-famine conditions were reported in some countries, and South Sudan was one among them. In February 2017, famine was declared in South Sudan and has remained a persistent threat ever since.</p>



<h4><strong>When did the Hunger Crisis Start in South Sudan?</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan gained independence in 2011 from the Republic of Sudan. In 2005, a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), also known as the Naivasha Agreement, was signed between the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the Government of Sudan. This agreement ended more than two decades of war between rebels in South Sudan and the Government in Khartoum. Amidst the signing of the CPA and independence, South Sudan made important progress in state-building. National and State governments were formed along with the institutions that were necessary to ensure the rule of law.<br><strong>According to the World Bank, they made certain social and economic progress like:</strong></p>



<p>• The number of children enrolled in primary school increased six-fold between 2005 to 2012 from 300,000 to 1.8 million.<br>• Infant mortality decreased by 25%.<br>• The number of skilled midwives grew.<br>• Polio was eradicated.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this celebration was short-lived. The ruling political party (Sudan People’s Liberation Movement) that originally led the way for independence is now divided and fighting for power. After two years of its independence, it plunged into conflict. In December 2013, this political infighting erupted into violence in the streets of Juba, the capital of South Sudan, after South Sudan’s current President Salva Kiir accused its vice president Riek Machar of an attempted coup and the fight started between two factions of the Government. Violence spread like wildfire in South Sudan, displacing thousands of civilians who rushed to seek refuge in U.N bases. and This fight is continuing to date, becoming an increasingly brutal civil war, and affecting the entire country.</p>



<p>In 2015 after peace negotiations, both parties signed an Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS). Unfortunately, this agreement did not end the violence instead, which has spread across the entire country, now splintered along ethnic, political, and regional lines. The conflict has affected nearly everyone and raised deep economic and social problems in the country.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="226" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\graph.PNG" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lpAg2_sWFsXdsroUGwSknO0Xc0O71adIYZgdHwGFlc1BFM-pjxqD7okbo8O7dmeau3nMZ6mnO2h6cL0wB9YriIdtuta_IPLEUFvr7JcN2CMNYrjUk_MYcISlyYYa-mj7L0BEIQ"></p>



<p>The ongoing conflict and insecurity have pushed millions to the brink of starvation for years. In 2017, famine was declared there. The famine crisis had taken a toll on the South Sudanese people making it difficult to access the required necessities of life like food, healthcare. Has destroyed everything in South Sudan like crops, health centers, and other required necessities of life. People there are without food and the economy has collapsed. Women and children are most vulnerable to the effects of food insecurity, malnutrition, and conflict.</p>



<p>Famine was declared officially in 2017 when people have already begun to starve to death. It is the diplomatic equivalent of a seven-alarm fire. Food shortage and famine in South Sudan are not sudden occurrences like the earthquake in Haiti and flooding in Indonesia but are rather a result of the prolonged and slow process of combined factors. Famine in the region is not caused by climate changes but it is the result of deeper structural and geopolitical anomalies. The maxim is true that famine does not result purely from natural causes but is “man-made”. Such a description, however, avoids any real accountability for those that have caused the crisis. South Sudan famine would be more accurately described as the “government made”. The most immediate cause lies within the tactics employed by the South Sudan government and its principal Rebel opponent in fighting the war.</p>



<p>Government and Rebel forces attack civilian areas much more than they attack each other. They target means of survival of civilian populations deemed to be unsupportive. The government has also concentrated attacks on sites where agricultural production traditionally fed large parts of South Sudan, not only leading to massive human displacement but also devastating local grain production which leads to hyperinflation in food prices.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\graph 3.PNG" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6387em3bns9BWM4CFsrg6M0aQhYxEtIA8uo-ZCbQ7nYhb3SNEA359D3YTzk5b56kbQEFH-aLDsCBs08qMWruiZVw6kFqr5uz4zRQthLwqRsAwxE63uUu8WeS6kWv0_VvxEb_Qw" width="383" height="263"></p>



<h4>What’s Happening in South Sudan Now?</h4>



<p>A handful of peace agreements between the current President Salva Kiir and the former rebel leader Riek Machar have been signed over the course of the war – the most recent in 2018 –but the treaty have been repeatedly violated. While reported incidents of conflict have decreased somewhat since the new deal, the situation in South Sudan remains highly unstable and outbreaks of violence continue to occur. Relatively small numbers of people have started to return home in light of the tenuous peace agreement, but new displacement remains high. Those affected are struggling to survive after years of a protracted conflict that has destroyed livelihoods, forced people to leave their homes, disrupted planting, and eliminated critical coping resources, like savings and livestock.</p>



<p>Many humanitarian organizations, including Mercy Corps, are working with the UN, using both private contributions and funding from the international community, to address the urgent needs of people in South Sudan.</p>



<h4>Effects of Conflict</h4>



<p>One of the worst hunger crises of the past 25 years was the famine in East Africa in 2011/2012.<br>Following a power crisis that erupted in 2013, South Sudan has spiraled into a conflict, which has spread across most parts of the country and resulting in the death of tens of thousands of people. The ongoing conflict that has engulfed the country of South Sudan results in high food prices, economic disruption, and low agricultural production. Due to these reasons, the UN and the Government of South Sudan were forced to declare famine in 2017.</p>



<p>Famines are an acute food crisis, usually after drought or due to armed conflict. Famine is the worst form of food shortage. In addition to old people, babies and small children are especially threatened by starvation. According to the United Nations definition (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), there is a famine if at least: 20% of households suffer from extreme food shortages, 30% of the population is acutely malnourished; and 2 out of every 10,000 people, or 4 children, die daily from food shortages.</p>

<p><em>Food insecurity in South Sudan as of September 2018</em>.</p>



<p>Hunger anywhere can have long-term, debilitating consequences, but it can be particularly threatening during a complex crisis just like the one in South Sudan. When people go hungry, they have trouble staying healthy and become more susceptible to dangerous diseases. Their bodies are not as strong or productive as they could be, which makes it difficult for them to work, find food, and keep their families safe at a time when they urgently need the strength to do so.</p>



<p>Children’s development is also seriously impacted by hunger. Without proper nutrition, they don’t hit critical developmental milestones, which may permanently inhibit their ability to reach their full potential find out and function for the rest of their lives. Hungry children don’t learn as well, and they are also at a higher risk of disease.</p>

<p><em>Nyaguande, 4, lives with her family in a displacement site since fleeing attacks at their home. More than half the populations of loopholes uprooted South Sudanese people are children.<br></em>According to <strong>United Nation Agencies</strong>, this conflict has pushed South Sudanese into hunger. Nearly 60% of the population (6.1 million people) has been pushed into extreme hunger. Children, there are at imminent risk of death from malnutrition. Children who survive malnutrition in early childhood face lifelong damage to their health and their physical and cognitive development. Even short bouts of hunger and malnutrition carry long-term cognizance.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Jeremy Hopkins</strong>, the South Sudan representative for the UN Children’s Agency, more than 2,00,000 children were at risk of death from malnutrition in the country.</p>



<p><strong>The World Food Programme reported</strong> that 67% of the South Sudanese population (4.9 million people) needed food urgently, and at least 100,000, according to the UN, were in imminent danger of death by starvation.</p>



<p>According to the <strong>Action Against Hunger report</strong>, conflict pushed more people into hunger in 2018, and malnutrition rates remained high. Two million people were initially displaced, and 2.3 million people have become refugees. The country is marked by excessive gender-based violence, declining economic opportunities, and strained health centers. Half of the children are not attending schools, and two-thirds of the population has no access to safe water.</p>

The people were predominantly farmers and war has disrupted agriculture. They have lost their livestock, even their farming tools.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Mercy Corps</strong>,<strong> more than 3 million </strong>people had been displaced by ongoing violence across the country, forcing families to abandon agricultural land and livestock to survive with few food resources. Over 4 million people &#8211; 1 in 3 – have been forced to flee their homes due to this brutal war. Nearly 2.5 million have fled to neighboring countries. There are now 1 million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, making up about half of the country’s total refugee population.</p>



<p>There were significant challenges for agencies delivering food in famine-affected areas. Civilians reported that the food they received was taken by soldiers involved in the fighting.</p>

<p>Angelina and her children fled their homes when their village erupted in violence. Having left everything behind, they survived by eating water lilies until being reached with food assistance.</p>



<h4><strong>Economic and Human costs of conflict</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan has very fertile soil and significant oil deposits. Its economy is dependent on exporting oil. Oil is near all that South Sudan exports. It generates about 60% of the country’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product). In 2016, South Sudan&#8217;s oil-dependent economy faced multiple major shocks including the eruption of conflict in the capital city Juba, disruptions in agricultural production, and a significant drop in international oil prices. The poor performance of the economy triggered several economic crises, the cost of necessities, particularly food skyrocketed. The price of staple foods, such as Sorghum, maize, and beans, are at record highs.</p>



<p>The human cost of the conflict is enormous. The World Bank estimates that poverty had risen significantly from 44.7% in 2011 to 66% in 2016. Poverty is so deeper than in the period before the conflict. According to the World Bank, there is significant gender disparity, indicating few educational opportunities for the generation of women. Male literacy is 40%, while the female literacy rate is only 16%. Other indicators of poverty include high infant mortality rate and high maternal mortality rate.</p>



<h4><strong>Who is Most Affected by this crisis?</strong></h4>



<p>Women and children are disproportionately impacted by the conflict in South Sudan. The majority of the population of the United Nations displacement sites is made up of women and children, with more than 60% of South Sudanese refugees being under age 18.</p>



<p>Additionally, sexual violence towards women and girls is pervasive. The United Nations recently reported a surge in sexual attacks, including women and girls experiencing abuse during raids on their homes. The people committing these crimes are rarely held responsible.</p>



<p>To make the situation even more difficult, women and girls continue to bear the burden of family caretaking even during crises crisis. In the face of increased violence, recurring displacement, and loss of livelihoods, daily tasks like collecting water and firewood make them continual targets for attack.</p>



<h4><strong>How is the Hunger Crisis being Tackled in South Sudan?</strong></h4>



<p>It is widely acknowledged that the South Sudan food emergency is man-made. Human actions, particularly the proliferation of Armed factions and military groups continue to make humanitarian response extremely difficult and restrict access to markets, farms, and medical services. However, there are national as well as international organizations that are working to mitigate the impact of the hunger crisis on the lives of south sudanase. Some of the organizations which are working in tackling the hunger crisis in South Sudan are:</p>



<p><strong>• United Nation Agencies</strong></p>



<p>The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (FAO), the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and World Food Programme (WFP) called for sustainable peace across the country, and unhindered, safe access to all areas where people who survived the fighting but are left without nothing are in, and need of life-saving assistance. According to Mahimbo Mdoe, UNICEF’s Representative in South Sudan, more than 80% of children treated recover, which makes it even more urgent to access those who have suffered the most as a result of the fighting. UNICEF and partners have admitted 147421 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition into various outpatient treatment programs (OTP) and stabilization centers since January 2018. So far, FAO supported 1.4 million farmers with agricultural seeds and tools during the main planting season so that they can increase cereal production. During the planting season, FAO distributes over 4,800 tons of crop seeds. WFP provides life-saving emergency food supplies, food in return for work to construct and rehabilitate community assets, food for school meals, and special products for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in children, and pregnant and nursing women. So far in 2018, WFP has reached 3.1 million people with 30,000 tons of food.</p>



<p><strong>• Non-Governmental Organization</strong></p>



<p>Oxfam has a strong and established team working tirelessly from 10 bases across the country, providing essential services and helping to keep people alive. According to them, they are working in South Sudan to deliver timely and effective humanitarian aid to help people affected by the conflict. It is currently supporting over 5,00,000 people with humanitarian assistance, including clean water, hygiene facilities, food, fuel, and income support.</p>



<p><strong>• Government Initiatives in tackling the crisis</strong></p>



<p>The Government of South Sudan is particularly concerned about hunger among South Sudanese school-aged children, many of whom rely heavily on free meals provided in schools. School meals for students in South Sudan are mainly provided by WFP, the same U.N. agency sounding the alarm over the potential famine. But WFP is only able to reach close to half a million students, against a total of 3 million to 3.5 million students.<br>In 2018, WFP and South Sudan’s government (Ministry of Education) launched a five-year strategy that aims to shift the current school meal set-up from relying solely on imported food to increase production for locally grown food. To increasingly using produce grown by local communities. The government is looking at external support to plug in additional resources and aims to increase its allocation for school meals.<br>In 2018, a Peace Agreement, R-ARCSS (Revitalization Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan) was signed between the current President Salva Kiir and the former rebel leader Riek Machar. As a result, Machar rejoined the Government and resumed his Vice President&#8217;s duties. This deal certainly offers a promising end to South Sudan’s conflict.<br>President Kiir also signed a declaration (Khartoum Declaration of Agreement) with the leaders of Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), giving amnesty to the troops, army generals, and leaders of SPLM. The amnesty included Vice President Machar which also and was an important gesture showing Kiir’s commitment to moving on from the senseless war.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan, the world’s youngest country has the world’s highest rates of population growth and maternal mortality, and less than 30% of the population is literate. The country has abundant natural resources, but less than 200 miles of paved roads.</p>



<p>The Peace Agreement 2015 which was viewed as a milestone towards ending the conflict unfortunately did not prove to be successful enough. the violence continued in South Sudan instead of this agreement. The conflict which began with a political dispute will not be resolved by simply reconciling rival political leaders. The manipulation and atrocities committed by combatants against civilians are likely to have long-term effects.</p>



<p>The world must do everything it can do to treat the symptoms of this emergency but much attention is to be paid to address the root cause of the crisis. The situation in South Sudan is desperate and urgent. The fact that the crisis is man-made means that it is within human power to end it. Currently, millions of lives can be saved which are on the verge of starvation. But the window opportunity is very limited. Humanitarian aid alone cannot end the conflict, nor can it fully respond to the devastating impacts of conflict on individuals, their livelihood, and national economies that have been lingering for decades. But taking a sustainable approach by investing in integrating development efforts such as social protection and social safety can reduce the risk of recurrence of a lethal upcoming crisis. The new approach must prioritize safeguarding livelihoods and institutions as well as saving lives.</p>



<p>The country’s most immediate need is to end the brutal and senseless conflict that has displaced more than one-third of the population so that people can return to their homes and resume farming to prevent additional periods of near-famine conditions. South Sudan’s refugees should receive the same support and attention as refugees from elsewhere. Refugees are an international responsibility; which has to be shared. The refugee protection regime is enhanced through dedicated international cooperation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility-sharing among all states.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis across the globe, with an estimated 24 million people, which makes about 80 percent of the total population in grave need of humanitarian assistance including millions of children.<br>Yemen officially known as The Republic of Yemen is a nation situated at the Southern end of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia, covering the second largest part of the Arabian Peninsula as being a Sovereign State.<br>Since the conflict arose, civilians of Yemen have been the victim of bad governance, holding a range of unredressed grievances that include violence, attacks, arbitrary detentions, torture, and enforced disappearances. Moreover, humanitarian aid has been impeded from time to time, and problems such as violence against women, famine, poverty; diseases have taken a spike. The ongoing conflict has damaged the economy and infrastructure of the country on a larger scale, leading to the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe.</p>



<h4>Historical perspective: Yemeni Civil War</h4>



<p>In ancient times, Yemen was ruled by Sabaeans, which prospered as a trading state for centuries altogether. Later, the Jewish influenced Himyarite Kingdom came into existence. Religions, primarily Christianity and Islam, grew rapidly in the 4th and 7th centuries, respectively. It can be seen that the administration of Yemen has long been in a state of turmoil, from the emergence of different dynasties to the unification of Northern and Southern Yemen, forming the present Republic of Yemen.<br>To begin with, the conflict of Yemen has its roots in the non-fulfillment of political transition supposed to bring firmness following an Arab Spring uprising that forced its long-time president, Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over his power to his deputy Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. But unfortunately, Mr. Hadi could not deal with many problems such as separatist movement in the south, attacks by jihadists, unemployment, corruption, food shortage, etc. Besides, a Houthi movement known as Ansar Allah led by Yemen’s Zaidi- Shia Muslim minority, fought several rebellions against Saleh and took advantage of Hadi’s inability by taking the northern province of Saada and vicinity under control.<br>Disillusioned with the transition, many Yemeni Sunnis supported Houthi, and later the rebellions gradually took over the capital city Sana’a. As a result of which two groups came into existence: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi &#8211; led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement along with their allies and supporters, both claiming to establish the official government of Yemen.</p>



<p>Sana’a which is controlled by Houthi forces along with its allies who were loyal to the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh conflict with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Also, attacks have been carried out by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL). At the same time, the Hadi government had clashes with United Arab Emirates (UAE) forces as a result of their military measures. The Houthi led supreme revolutionary committee after taking over Sana’a along with its government declared a mobilization to topple Hadi and extend their control by conquering southern Yemen.<br>The Saudi-led bombing campaign has been criticized largely by people at large which has resulted in the mass killing of civilians as per the Yemen data project.<br>Furthermore, according to a report, the Saudi led coalition attacked Houthi Saleh forces in support of President Hadi. As the war continued, alliances broke, and Saleh was assassinated in a clash. Consequently, war broke out between UAE backed Yemeni forces in Aden and Yemeni government forces due to which civilians suffered a spiraling economic crisis, lack of essential services, broken governance, health, education, and judicial systems.</p>



<h4><strong>Crisis in Yemen: Major Reasons</strong></h4>



<p>The intensity of the Crisis in Yemen can be understood with this, that even the delivery of much needed humanitarian aid is unlawfully impeded; the ongoing armed conflicts have affected the civilian population terribly, Airstrikes have been conducted by coalitions killing thousands of civilians. Moreover, Houthi forces recruited children, used banned landmines, and damaged major cities killing and injuring commoners. Activists and journalists have been threatened and harassed. Besides, Houthi forces have taken hostages, raped, and tortured detained migrants.<br>On the contrary, the imputability has been woefully inadequate even when there is much evidence of infringement of International law by the parties to the conflict.</p>



<p>●<strong> Unlawful Airstrike</strong><br>Human Rights Watch: An International non-governmental Organization has documented a number of airstrikes apparently conducted by the Saudi-led coalition, including deadly attacks on Yemen&#8217;s fishing boats. Further, it has been documented that, since the war began more than 20,100 airstrikes have been conducted on Yemen by a Saudi-led coalition that amounts to an average of 12 attacks a day. Destroying hospitals, market places, bridges, factories, detention centers, etc.</p>



<p>●<strong> Children and Armed Conflict</strong><br>According to a United Nation report on Yemen, all the parties to the conflict have used child soldiers under the age of 18 and 15 years, mostly recruited by Houthis.<br>The United Nation Secretary-General released an annual “list of shame” for violations against children in armed conflict, which has detailed that the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for the death and injury of 729 children, Houthis were responsible for the death of 398 children, and 58 children were killed and injured by Yemeni government forces. The irony here is that the secretary-general listed the Saudi-led coalition in this list on the one hand and categorized it as a step to improvisation on the other hand, despite the mounting evidence that these forces killed and harmed children on a larger scale.</p>



<p>● <strong>Arbitrary Detentions, Torture, and Enforced Disappearances.</strong><br>All the parties to the conflict in Yemen have arbitrarily detained people, abused them and subjected them to poor conditions, and forcibly abducted and disappeared people perceived to be political opponents or security threats.<br>It is evident from different reports that detention facilities controlled by UAE and UAE backed forces arbitrarily detained and tortured detainees, who are suspected to be members of ISIL and AQAP.<br>In the same way, Houthis have also been made responsible for dozens of cases of arbitrarily detaining and enforcing disappearances, while being subjected to torture and other ill-treatment which include beating with iron rods, rifles, and being hung from walls with their arms shackled behind them.<br>For these reasons, the female members of the families of the abducted men have protested in front of the prisons in major cities of Yemen hoping for their kidnapped sons, fathers, brothers to be searched, these have been grouped under a name which is “Mothers of Abductees Association”. This association reported the Disappearance of 3,478 cases, among which 128 were killed.<br>Not only this but, academicians, students, Politicians, Journalists, and other minority groups have reported being harassed by Houthis.</p>



<p>●<strong> Landmines</strong><br>Reportedly, Houthis have installed landmines throughout Yemen, such as anti-personnel mines, improvised explosive devices, and anti-vehicle mines along the western coast of Yemen, causing hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries. In addition to which, aid workers’ abilities to reach vulnerable people got obstructed. Their use has been documented in six governorates. Since the conflict arose, at least 140 civilians, including 19 children&#8217;s lives have been put to an end because of these landmines. While landmines have been planted in farmlands, roads, villages, and wells civilians access have been prevented especially farmers whose life completely depends upon crops and water. Demining efforts also face many problems.</p>



<p>● <strong>Famine</strong><br>Millions of people are starving in Yemen; half of them are suffering extreme levels of hunger or are a step away from famine. The percentage of famine cases is increasing year by year. Two-third of all districts in Yemen are already pre-famine. Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) reported that more than 85,000 civilians have died as a result of ongoing famine.<br>On the other hand, food shortage is gravely affecting IDPs and host communities, marginalized groups, landless wage laborers, and the fishing communities. In addition to this, it has been warned that more than 13 million Yemenis face starvation and that it could become “the worst famine in the world in 100 years”.</p>



<h4><strong>Need for Humanitarian Aid:</strong></h4>



<p>In order to survive, a large number of people seek humanitarian assistance. The situation is getting exacerbated year by year with the millions of Yemenis facing hunger, health issues, and other problems. Among the countries, 29 million inhabitants’, 24 million people need some sort of protection. While some have fewer needs, others have severe needs. Out of every 10 Yemeni civilians, more than 8 are in need of humanitarian aid, being the only option left with them.</p>



<h4><strong>Agreements by the Parties to the conflict:</strong></h4>



<p>The Peace talks in United Nations between the Houthis and the Yemeni government in December 2018, (when the special envoy of United Nations Secretary-General for Yemen brokered a cease-fire, known as the Stockholm Agreement) led to the termination of hostilities in the coastal towns of Hodeida, Salif, and Ras’ Issa. But, their agreement did not include other ground fightings and the new military funds.<br>The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi urged International scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s International Law infringements in Yemen and other states’ potential complicity in abuses through arms sales. Few European countries such as Norway, Finland, Netherlands, and Germany either reviewed or suspended their arms sales to members of the Saudi-led coalition, on the other hand, countries including the US, Canada, France, and Australia are still supplying military weapons.</p>



<h4>Governmental Initiatives:</h4>



<p>In terms of area, most part of Yemen is controlled by the official Yemen government. But, when it comes to population, major cities such as Sana&#8217;a and Sa&#8217;dah are controlled by Houthi forces. Thus, even if the government takes certain steps or initiatives, implementation becomes difficult.<br>As such, the vision of Yemen&#8217;s government is to elevate Yemen&#8217;s international ranking to that of a medium ‘human development’ country. While, trying to stop the growing threat of famine and negotiate with different nations to effectively try to unblock imports, ensure distribution of aid, and counteract a lack of foreign exchange in this nation. But, still, Yemen’s weak governance capacity and poor fiduciary environment have hampered its access to reach out to people in need. Reportedly, Yemen’s government is helpless, as the Houthis have seized most of its weapons during the coup. So, Due to the lack of resources, it is not able to cope up with the consequences of conflict.</p>



<h4><strong>What Can Be Done:</strong></h4>



<p>The conflict has had a polarizing impact on society at the local level. Thus, initiatives must be taken to help alleviate the crisis and they are as follows;</p>



<p>⮚ <strong>First</strong>, emphasis should be made on the importance of practical solutions. While easing the pressure on people with the help of humanitarian efforts and focusing on depoliticizing the supply of food and health care<br>⮚ <strong>Second</strong>, negotiations regarding the conflict and safe humanitarian access, and aid pipelines must be worked out by all the parties to the conflict. So, nations across the world should contest any efforts that allow Houthis to remain armed.<br>⮚<strong> Third</strong>, parties to the conflict must respect the international humanitarian law and have an obligation to take certain precautions to limit the impact of conflict on civilians.<br>⮚<strong> Fourth</strong>, the government must ensure that public sector workers are paid salaries so that the continuation of essential services is not hindered.<br>⮚<strong> Fifth</strong>, diplomatic channels should remain open and humanitarian financing and action needs to be impartial and neutral.<br>⮚ <strong>Sixth</strong>, a bit can be done by individuals across the globe by donating through the number of organizations and foundations working for this cause.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>It cannot be denied that for years, the United Nations and its partners have been trying to protect the people of Yemen. For example, each month, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) distributes 1 lac metric tons of food, which reaches more than 8 million Yemenis; The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has provided cholera vaccines to more than 3 lac people; United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)has provided reproductive health services to 2,50,000 women, and the United Nation Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) works with the government at all levels to increase coordination and betterment.<br>Despite this, the conflict of Yemen is multifaceted and characterized by deep mistrust. Virtually, everyone in Yemen has been the victim of this destructive armed conflict and the past five years have left the people completely exhausted.<br><br></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>The use of children as soldiers in armed conflicts is among the most morally repugnant practices in the Children are combatants in nearly three-quarters of the world&#8217;s conflicts. Yet moral reasons aside, compelling strategies are being continuously discussed and planned for limiting the use of child soldiers.ASeveralinternational laws and rules have been framed in this regard.<br>Today, It is against the international legislation that protects the rights of children to use children in welfare nevertheless it still remains a persistent issue in conflict-torn areas of the world. Children are used in direct combat, support roles like cooks and messengers, and as suicide bombers, to name a few duties—as child soldiers.<br>Further, the experts say, when conflicts involving children end, the prospects for a lasting peace are hurt by large populations of psychologically scarred, demobilized child soldiers.An also, countries that are more into recruiting child soldiers risk long-term instability as generations of youth are sucked into the wars.</p>



<h4>Definition: What is meant by a child soldier?</h4>



<p><strong>Child Soldier: </strong>&#8220;A person under the age of 18 recruited either voluntarily or by force to participate in an armed forces group in any capacity&#8221;.<br>A child soldier is not just someone who is involved in the fighting. They can also be those in other roles such as cooks, porters, messengers, human shields, spies, suicide bombers, or those used for sexual exploitation. It includes children recruited and trained for military purposes, but not used in war.<br>A child soldier or a child associated with an armed force group, according to the Paris Principles in 2007, &#8220;is any person, 18 years of age or younger, who is or has been recruited or used by an armed group in any capacity&#8221; (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), 2007).</p>



<h4>Brief History</h4>



<p>Child soldiers is not a new phenomenon and have been a norm throughout history, accepted in almost all societies until relatively recently. History is filled with children who have been trained and used for fighting, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, used as sex slaves, or recruited for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda.<br>The world had seen several such cases In the past, for example, when Napoleon recruited thousands of teenagers in his army, or when thousands of children were forced into different armies during the First and Second World War.<br>Children continued to be used throughout the 20th and early 21st century in every continent, with concentrations in parts of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. It is only in recent times that international efforts have begun to limit and reduce the military use of children.</p>



<h4>Reasons for the Recruitment of Children</h4>



<p>Children are and have been recruited in all parts of the world. They are recruited either by state armed forces(controlled by the government)or by non-state armed groups(armed groups outside government control) which include non-state armed paramilitary organisations, using children, such as militias, insurgents, terrorist organisations, guerrilla movements, ideologically or religiously-driven groups, armed liberation movements, and other types of quasi-military organisation, for different reasons e.g</p>



<p>● Multiple sources/reports claim that children are comparatively easy targets when it comes to radicalisation, manipulation, or intimidation, being one of the reasons why children are recruited as soldiers. Also as children are more obedient than adults and do not have a developed sense of danger, it is easy for recruiters to train and use children in any desired situation.</p>



<p>● In combat, children can be daring and tenacious, particularly when under the influence of drugs—a common practice—or when compelled by political or religious zeal. Child units can greatly add to confusion on battlefields, slowing opposing forces’ progress.</p>



<p>● In addition to this, children do not require many resources to maintain and thus are easily manageable.<br>Many times children choose by themselves to become child soldiers.<br>Giving away one&#8217;s childhood and becoming a soldier at that age is not a happy choice, a child would make. There are several reasons why children choose this path for themselves and become soldiers:</p>



<p>● Children who join voluntarily often do not have a full understanding of the consequences of joining, or of the severity and danger of their tasks. Reasons children freely choose to join militant groups may be many, e.g., their families identify with a side of The conflict, and they feel they are honoring their families and their countries by choosing to fight; a survival tactic where militant groups promise safety and a sense of family; they are pledged to some type of pay off, or they have a sense of vengeance for lived inequalities that they feel war can correct.</p>



<p>● In many cases, children choose to join as a result of economic or social pressures. Being poor, displaced, separated from their families, or living in a combat zone can make children particularly vulnerable to being recruited.</p>



<h4>Roles of Child Soldiers</h4>



<p>Child soldiers can take on a number of roles in armed conflicts and are recruited as young as the age of 8, any of them will be used in direct combat, as early as the age of 10, because modern assault rifles are easily managed by small children making child soldiers as useful and deadly in combat as adult soldiers. According to Singer, besides combat, typical roles for child soldiers are patrolling and surveillance, scouting or spying, and prisoner guard. These traditional soldier roles are often taken on by boys more often than girls. Not surprisingly, given what we know about human and sex trafficking worldwide, girls who are recruited into armed conflict are more often used as sex slaves or taken as wives or mistresses by army leaders. Other roles may be to act as cooks, porters, messengers, suicide bombers, etc.</p>



<h4>Global Estimate and the Current Situation:</h4>



<p>● According to the report of Child Soldiers International, 201, the number of children involved in armed conflicts has risen 159% since 2012, with almost 30,000 verified cases of recruitment in 17 countries around the globe.T he involvement of girls in armed conflict has more than quadrupled between 2017 and 2018, growing from 216 to 893 reported cases</p>



<p>● The reports also state that fifty countries still allow children to be recruited into armed forces and that children under the age of 18 were seven being recruited and trained for military purposes in 46 countries; of these, most recruit from age 17, fewer than 20 recruits from age 16, and an unknown, smaller number, recruit younger children. States that still rely on children to staff their armed forces include the world&#8217;s three most populous countries (China, India, and the United States) and the most economically powerful (all G7 countries apart from Italy and Japan).</p>



<p>● United Nations in 2017 Identified 14 countries where children were widely used by such groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.</p>



<p>● In 2017, the UN Secretary-General&#8217;s annual &#8220;name and shame&#8221; list highlighted the armed forces of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for recruiting and using under-18s for armed conflict. But non-state armed groups also recruit children in these and other countries. The report said there were at least 4000 verified violations by government forces and over 11,500 by non-state armed groups in the 20 country situations is examined.</p>



<p>● Also, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hired child soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur) to fight against Houthis during the Yemeni Civil War (2015-present).</p>



<h4>Impact on Children</h4>



<p>“The child is recognized, universally, as a human being who must be able to develop physically, mentally, socially, morally, and spiritually, with freedom and dignity.”A child soldier, as against this, does not enjoy any of the mentioned rights or happiness in his life and lives an entirely different life filled with horror, misery, and violence. They are acting as child soldiers affect children physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, and morally as well.<br>The scale of the impact on children was first acknowledged by the international community in a major report commissioned by the UN General Assembly, Impact of Armed Conflict on Children (1996), which was produced by the human rights expert Graça Machel.</p>



<p><strong>● Physical injuries, Health issues, and death:</strong> The 1996 report was particularly concerned with the use of younger children, presenting evidence that many thousands of children were being killed, maimed, and psychiatrically injured around the world every year. In addition to injuries, child soldiers may face a variety of other health problems, including malnutrition, poor hygiene, and health care, respiratory and skin infections, and punishment by physical abuse or deprivation.</p>



<p><strong>● Drug addiction:</strong> Some armed groups force children to use drugs to desensitize them to violence and enhance their performance. The use of cocaine, amphetamines, and other stimulants is especially common. These drugs can cause lasting harm to the bodies and minds of child soldiers. Children leaving armed groups that force drug use may have a difficult time overcoming drug addiction and withdrawal.</p>



<p><strong>● Sexual exploitation: </strong>All child soldiers are vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation by others in the armed group. The risks are usually much higher for girls, and the exploitation of girls is rising too. Sexually abused girls are at high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Girls are at risk of unwanted pregnancies. These pregnancies can be very dangerous for the girls, who are often mal-nourished, physically immature, and living in unsanitary conditions.</p>



<p><strong>● Psychological distress:</strong> In addition to the physical vulnerabilities they face, child soldiers’ social and psychological development is often damaged by their experience in the armed group. Children are routinely exposed to terrible acts of violence and brutality. Researches have found that more than half of former child soldiers show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and are more likely than other children to exhibit aggression and anti-social behavior.</p>



<p><strong>● Poverty and Unemployment:</strong> The combined impact of all mentioned effects typically includes a high risk of poverty and lasting unemployment in adulthood.</p>



<h4>International Laws and International Efforts</h4>



<p>International efforts at protecting the rights of children started in 1924 with the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child.</p>



<p>● The Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child was just five Articles adopted by the League of Nations, stating that “mankind owes to the Child the best that it has to give, declare and accept it as their duty that, beyond and above all considerations of race, nationality or creed” (League of Nations, 1924, paragraph 1). Following this legislation, the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of the Child was adopted in 1959 which consisted of 10 principles to ensure for all children that “he [and she] may have a happy childhood and enjoy for his [and⁷ her] own good and for the good of society the rights and freedoms herein set forth” (United Nations, 1959, The General Assembly). Following these short declarations, in 1989 a 54-Article long Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified with thorough explanations of who is considered a child and the responsibilities of the state to ensure protection and education to children in their varying cultural and political contexts (United Nations, 1989).</p>



<p>● Then in 1997 Cape Town Principles, although not a legal document, was adopted. These principles represent an important consensus among major international NGOs and UNICEF and offer useful guidance in developing policies and programs that protect and support child soldiers. In addition to defining key terms, the principles provide a comprehensive overview of appropriate action related to the prevention of recruitment, demobilization, and reintegration of child soldiers.</p>



<p>● Later the 2009 list of the Six Grave Violations Against Children During Armed Conflict tried to expand the responsibility and efforts of citizens and governments on an international level to intervene in and prevent the recruitment of child soldiers, protect the rights of children, and to react to the engagement of children in warfare.(United Nations, 2002; United Nations, 2013; UNICEF, 1997; UNICEF 2007).</p>



<p>● The highest standard in the world is set by the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which forbids state armed forces from recruiting children under the age of 18 under any circumstances. It further requires State Parties to protect civilians and ensure respect for all rules of international humanitarian law applicable to children in all armed conflict, including internal conflict. Most African states have ratified the Charter.<br>Now, although international laws and principles, have undoubtedly been framed and adopted to restrict the recruitment of child soldiers, surely the main factor that makes legislation effective is the consequences of violation. These documents, however, are declarations, proclamations, conventions, and statements of best practices. Therefore, only countries who are members of the United Nations, sign the optional protocol(OPAC), and subscribe to the ideas and articles presented in the other documents are expected to abide by them. While countries may be highlighted by human rights watch organizations, “shamed” by the UN secretary-general, or other countries may refuse to engage in trade with them, there are rarely any concrete and legal consequences unless initiated and handed out by the governing state.</p>



<h4><strong>Role of UN</strong></h4>



<p>● The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and others have called for an end to the recruitment of children by state armed forces, arguing that military training, the military environment, and abiding contract of service are not compatible with children&#8217;s rights and jeopardize healthy development during adolescence.</p>



<p><strong>● Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict:</strong> The already mentioned Machel Report of 1996 also led to a new mandate for a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG-CAAC). Among the tasks of the SRSG is to draft the Secretary-General&#8217;s annual report on children and armed conflict, which lists and describes the worst situations of child recruitment and use from around the world. (Taken from &#8220;Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict&#8221;)</p>



<p><strong>● Security Council:</strong> The United Nations Security Council convenes regularly to debate, receive reports, and pass resolutions under the heading &#8220;Children in armed conflict&#8221;. United Nations Secretary-General In 2011 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon raised the issue of children in conflict areas who are involved in violent activities according to the Extreme Measures report.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>Child soldiers are being utilized all over the globe and thousands of violations of international declarations occur every year. These violations are easiest to track through the United Nations Secretary-General’s report. The most significant efforts to decrease and eliminate the use of child soldiers lie in getting more countries and non-state sanctioned military organisations on board with the Children, Not Soldiers campaigns and to pledge to prohibit military involvement for anyone under the age of 18. Countries, all over the world, must powerfully and effectively incorporate the international laws for the protection of children in their domestic legislation. Yet, of course, the most effective way to stop the use of child soldiers is to end the conflicts in which they fight. &#8220;Child soldiers will be used by [warring] parties for as long as the war continues. There must be a political solution, and conflicts must be resolved, as many as possible.<br></p>
