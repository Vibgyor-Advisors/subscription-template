<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>&nbsp;Education is one of the most important things in man’s life. It shapes the character of an individual and makes him able to distinguish between right and wrong. Education promotes individual freedom and dignity and provides for all-round personality. With education, a person discovers himself/herself in a place where he /she can look outside all around the world. A well-educated man is a more dependable worker, a better citizen, a center of wholesome influence, pride to his community, and honor to his country. The right to education is distinguished as a human right. The right to education is an inherent right. This right is to eliminate discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards of education, and to provide quality education. The Right to Education Act lays down responsibilities on the Centre, State, and local authorities for its proper implementation. India, as a nation is actively making various provisions for practical education to the children and youth across the country.</p>



<h4>Origin of Right to Education in India:</h4>



<p>The right to education in India has a vast history. Before independence, the education sector of India remained under the British rulers who did not do much for its development. At the end of the British rule literacy rate of India was 12%. India attained independence in 1947 and to bring a newly independent country in parallel to other developed nations, there was a lot of debate among the members of the constituent assembly. The constituent committee first proposed to include the right to Primary Education in Part III (Fundamental Rights) of the constitution, however, the advisory committee later rejected the proposal. It was then placed in the category of Directive Principles of State Policy.</p>



<p>As a result,<strong> the National Policy for Education (NPE)</strong> was declared in 1968 which has been made responsible for considerable expansion of education all over the country at all levels. However, due to a lack of financial and administrative support, gaps in implementation remained. In 1986 the government published a document that acted as a base for a new NPE. Even it was not able to bring adequate results.</p>



<p>Then in 2002, the 86th amendment to the constitution provided the Right to Education as Fundamental Right under Article 21-A. The same amendment provided for follow-up legislation that gave birth to the Right to Education Act (RET) 2009 and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) which was declared as apex monitoring authority of RTE. The government is committed to providing universal elementary education (primary and upper primary) for all children aged 6-14 years of age through its program called Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).</p>



<h4><strong>Law For Education In India:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The education</strong> system has been focused in India since the pre-independence period. However, since post-independence various efforts are being made to make the education system better. Different laws, policies, and programs have been introduced from time to time for the free and compulsory use of children. The landmark law for education in India is Right to Education (RTE) which was introduced in the year 2009 and came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> April 2010.</p>



<h4>Right to Education Act (RTE) 2009:</h4>



<p>The Right to Education Act provides free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14 years. This right enforces as Fundamental Right. Under this Act, it is mandatory to reserve 25% seats for the children belonging to disadvantaged sections of society which include scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, socially backward classes, and differently able children. This Act also set some standards for schools, which include pupil/teacher ratio, infrastructure, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Salient Features of RTE Act:</strong></p>



<p>1.  During elementary school, no child is required to submit any school fee or other stationery expenses.</p>



<p>2.  Punishments to children are forbidden. No teacher is allowed to inflict any corporal punishment or mental harassment on children.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be age-appropriate admission to children irrespective of their education level.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be separate toilets for the boys and girls in every school.</p>



<p>5.  No child should be detained up to elementary level.</p>



<p>6.  Curriculum should be devised as per the values enshrined in the constitution. It should ensure the all-round development of children.</p>



<p>7.  The teachers must be properly trained to impart education to elementary classes.</p>



<h4>Developments in Education Sector During Last Decade:</h4>



<p>Almost a decade ago, the government of India came up with a Right to Education (RTE) Act which made education a fundamental right and ensured free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years of age. Despite the structural loopholes and administrative lapses, the RTE Act has achieved success by realizing its prime objectives which include:</p>



<p><strong>1.  Increase in Enrollment:</strong></p>



<p>The RTE Act has successfully managed to increase enrollment of children in the elementary classes. As per the report, nationally, during 2009-2016, there has been a 19.4% increase in enrollment in elementary classes. The total enrollment stood at 927.2 % in schools in the year 2018[1].</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Improved Infrastructure Norms:</strong></p>



<p>The RTE Act has also achieved its objective of improved and proper infrastructure in schools. According to a report by ASER, the number of usable toilets has increased and has reached to 66.4% in 2018. There has been a significant increase in schools with boundary walls and kitchen shed. Also, an increase in the supply of books and other stationery items is observed in recent years.</p>



<p><strong>3.  Quality Education:</strong></p>



<p>Reports reveal that most of the states in India have adopted the curriculum as prescribed by the RTE Act. In schools (govt.), 80% of the teachers are professionally qualified to teach the children of elementary classes.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Adequate Girl Toilet Facilities:</strong></p>



<p>After the enforcement of the RTE Act, there has been an increase in the percentage of schools that are equipped with toilets for female children. Reports suggest that there has been an increase from 59% to 85% in the year 2018.</p>



<p><strong>5.  Maintenance of Pupil Teacher Ratio:</strong></p>



<p>There has been an increase in the number of teachers working in the government and aided schools which have resulted in a drop from 46% to 33% in the schools that don’t maintain the Pupil-Teacher Ratio.</p>



<h4>Shortcomings of Right to Education in India:</h4>



<p>The Right to Education (RTE) Act lacks teeth when it comes to enforcement of the provisions, the act suffers from some serious flaws. Some of them include:</p>



<p><strong>1.  No accountability:</strong></p>



<p>Right to Education Act, 2009 consists of 7chapters and 39 sections but not a single provision of this act deals with a penalty. There is no penalty for parents who deliberately don&#8217;t send their children to school and also no prescribed penalties for the government authorities which fail in discharging their respective duties under this Act.</p>



<p><strong>2.  Lack of policies and resources:</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;The government has not taken any major steps to enforce RTE. There is definitely a lack of resources and teachers. The share of schools that comply with the Right to Education guidelines has increased by a mere 3.7 percent during the last decade which is too low. The government is working very slowly in the implementation of the RTE Act. RTE Act 2009 fails to provide quality education to the children due to a lack of professionally qualified teachers.</p>



<p><strong>3.  Failure to provide full assistance:</strong></p>



<p>The 25% of seats reserved for EWS (economically weaker section) in private or unaided schools, even if the state paid for the tuition, who would pay for the rest? Who would pay for uniform, books, and the extra reading material, the dress for the annual day dance, the shoes, transport, and much more? This provision needs alteration and the state government should open its pockets to pay extra charges that the private schools are charging.</p>



<p><strong>4.  Socialization barriers for special abled children:</strong></p>



<p>This act contains a clause that motivates the elementary education of children with disabilities at home which is a good step but it leads to depression in children because such children are not able to socialize. The infrastructure of the schools doesn’t have adequate facilities for such children.</p>



<p><strong>5.  Another major flaw of the RTE Act,</strong> 2009 is that the act applies only to majority run schools; all minority educational run institutions are exempted from the provisions of this Act.</p>



<h4>Steps to Make Right to Education More Effective:</h4>



<p>Although the right to education has changed the education system in India yet there are many things to be done to make it more effective. Few steps which need to be taken include:</p>



<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Give incentives for schooling</strong>:</p>



<p>&nbsp;In poor families, kids are seen as helping hands, the more the better. They help in household chores and in the farm, besides earning money from labor jobs. Their contribution is quite significant for the survival of the family as a whole. Sending them to school takes this support away from the family. Hence, in order to educate them the following steps are an absolute necessity:</p>



<p>a)&nbsp; &nbsp; Monetary support to parents for sending kids to school.</p>



<p>b)&nbsp; &nbsp; Mid-day meal schemes etc.</p>



<p><strong>2.  Establish ownership and responsibility</strong>:</p>



<p>&nbsp;Particularly in the rural and poor areas, people’s representatives – MPs, MLAs, Sarpanchs’ – should be made responsible for the smooth functioning of the schools in their areas. Local relevant NGOs and other organizations may also be involved. They can provide support through the School Management Committees.</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>Focus on teacher training programs:</strong></p>



<p>The quality of teachers is the backbone of any teaching program. Untrained or unmotivated teachers can mar any program, no matter how ambitious it is. Creating a standard training program to train and generate quality teachers is crucial for the RTE Act to produce meaningful results.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Use computer and satellite technology to create awareness and interest:</strong></p>



<p>Create mobile units that pay visits to different schooling centers, particularly in remote areas, and show relevant films to both the teachers and the students. This will help sustain interest and arouse curiosity. Even visiting once in a fortnight or month would serve the purpose.</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong>  <strong>Easily accessible schools</strong>:</p>



<p>The Government should also focus on the construction of schools at an easily accessible distance. Traveling long distances to reach schools is the key factor for dropping out of school. The government should identify places near land dwellings so that children don’t face any troubles reaching schools.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong>  <strong>Awareness Campaigns:</strong></p>



<p>There must be more and more awareness among the common masses regarding the importance of education and the facilities available under the RTE Act.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Education undoubtedly remains the most important part of an individual. Knowledge brings prosperity to a nation. However, the nation as a whole is liable to provide for the proper provision and implementation of education in the country. India has recognized the right to education as a fundamental right for over a decade now, yet there remain primary loopholes that are responsible for its poor implementation. The primary fault of the RTE Act is its failure to recognize the main reason for the education crisis. The provisions of the RTE Act must be revisited with a view to making the education sector healthy and better. We need not write-off the RTE Act, 2009 as another failed legislation but should instead see it as a stepping stone to reform as per the people&#8217;s perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
