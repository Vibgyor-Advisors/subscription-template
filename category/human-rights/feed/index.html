<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Data privacy is of greater importance in a world with ever-growing mountains of big data. During the earlier times, the consumers used to share their personal information or data via the offline platform where the chances of data privacy risks were minimal, however, with the growing technology, the consumers in this digital age share their vital information on the online platform, be it on social media sites, E-commerce sites and other Apps to perform certain kind of actions.</p>



<p>The concept of data privacy in this modern era is usually applied to critical personal information also known as Personally Identifiable Information. Such information is used for the purpose of identification of any person like the driver’s license number, bank account number, passport number, etc. and Personal Health Information in a medical record used for the identification of any person which was disclosed, created, or used in the course of providing a health care service. Of late with such a sensitive and personal data record, it becomes challenging when it attempts to use the data while protecting an individual’s personally identifiable information and privacy preferences.</p>



<h4><strong>Digitization of Services</strong></h4>



<p>While the consumers are sharing personal data on online platforms that collect growing amounts of information on the one hand, they have started visualising the danger in such data collection on the other hand. Data privacy has become more important in this digitalized world and those platforms collecting the vital information of an individual should be highly concerned with their data privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy </strong></h4>



<p>Primarily, privacy is the Right of a citizen of being free from public scrutiny or from having one’s personal information shared. Data Privacy is the right of the citizen to have control over how one’s personal information is collected and used. It deals with the practices which ensure that the data so shared by any person must be used for its intended purpose.</p>



<p>Most of the time, Data privacy is confused with Data security and is used interchangeably however, data privacy and data security are, by no means, the same terms.</p>



<p>Like, if you are using a Google Gmail account, your password would be a method of data security, while the way Google uses your data to administer your account would be data privacy.</p>



<p>Data security is a prerequisite to Data privacy therefore it is possible to have healthy security stand without addressing data privacy. However, it is not possible to ensure Data privacy without a solid security stand.</p>

<h4><strong>Data Privacy and Data Security</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2KHHHno84GIoPLml6egdIRtC3qUwPZSL9bAKfZaUI1VWU8IUNmof27Admq_NK2yVjxZIS5V95hg2b2ptpcoDxvZ5M5ZubUSfsGNUFk6iWz8uzI2TAcx6drqZDb3ER5cDDYjETP8g" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy a Real Major Concern</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In this age of digitization, personal data influences a lot of our activities. It affects nearly everything including from what content or messages we see on the internet to so many decisions made whether it’s about a job, a license, or a loan and thereby sway almost every aspect of our lives. Since the autonomy and control over our lives are one of the hallmarks of freedom which would be rendered useless if the important decisions about our lives are being made without our participation which might turn out to be one of the reasons which give rise to data privacy concerns.</p>



<p><strong>Various types of personal information that often come under privacy concerns may be listed as follows;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Financial Information</strong></h4>



<p>Any financial information which is shared online or offline is sensitive as it can be used maliciously by someone to commit fraud. In 2019, First American Financial Corp. had 885 million records exposed online including bank transactions, social security numbers, and more.</p>



<p>Data about an individual’s financial transaction like the positions held in stocks and funds, outstanding debts, amount of assets, and purchases is usually sensitive. The person concerned could be the victim of identity theft or fraud if the criminals get access to such information. Similarly, data about a person’s purchases can reveal a great lot of information like the medications used, places visited, contacts, activities, or habits. This data may also be used by the corporations for the purpose of targeting the individual concerned with marketing customized towards the personal preferences of those individuals which the person concerned may or may not approve.</p>



<h4><strong>Internet Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In the modern era, where most of the information is shared online be it on social networking sites or other Apps, people experience growing concern about privacy challenges. With the use of various search engines and data mining, it has become possible to collect and combine information from a wide variety of sources very easily.</p>



<p><strong>For instance the Aadhaar Data Breach:</strong></p>



<p> In 2018 there was a massive breach In India allowing access to private information of Aadhaar holders, exposing their names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and their bank details along with the photographs, thumbprints, retina scans, and other identifying details of nearly 1.1 billion citizens.</p>



<p>One of the most worrisome issues of today’s world is the ability of a third person to control the information one reveals over the internet and who can access that information, whether Email can be read or stored by third parties without consent if websites one visited can collect, store and possibly share the personal information, whether third parties can track the websites that someone visited, etc.</p>



<h4><strong>Locational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Locational Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Locational data is the most sensitive data being collected by tracking capabilities of mobile devices which have the potential to strip away locational privacy from individuals, making it possible to intrude into the lives of others by consulting location databases. In 2017, McDelivery leak disclosed home addresses and even exact coordinates of 2.2 million users.</p>



<p>By tracking the locational information, potentially sensitive professional and personal information like the presence of a person at an abortion clinic, an AIDS counselor, attendance of a religious place, etc. could be exposed which unfortunately poses a threat to locational privacy.</p>



<h4><strong>Medical Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Medical Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Confidentiality and privacy are essential to all trusting relationships such as that between a doctor and a patient. Patient confidentiality and protection of privacy have always been the basis of the doctor-patient relationship. People usually do not prefer that their medical records be revealed to others because of the fact that it may affect their medical insurance, employment, and that it may bring embarrassment upon them.</p>



<p>Medical privacy may include information relating to physical and sexual activity, genetic data, bodily functions, psychological problems, etc.</p>



<p>In 2018, the healthcare sector saw 15 million patient records compromised in 503 breaches, three times the amount seen in the previous year, according to the Protenus Breach Barometer.</p>



<h4><strong>Educational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In earlier days, photocopies, textbooks, and filmstrips supplied the entire educational content to the students. However, with the advancement of technology and telecommunications, the education system has greatly changed and a new system including personalized content, virtual forms of interaction, and interactive technologies has been introduced.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though the adopters of these technologies have proved their worth by transforming the educational process however, the use of high-tech education systems has proved to be a double-edged sword. Using information systems like Arcon and portal, tools like Microsoft Office and Google, educational Apps like Edmodo and Dropbox exposes the student data to a number of security and privacy risks. Technologies like information sharing, telecommunication innovations, and web-hosting also expose the information related to students to risks during their use.</p>



<p>In 2020, cybersecurity firm Cybele discovered at least 530,000 zoom accounts listed for sale on a dark web hacker forum for $0.0020 cents.</p>



<p>The data relating to students so exposed or improperly disclosed can cause significant harm to students where students may indulge in violating each other’s privacy like online gossip, cyberbullying, etc. Besides, it can also result in a misunderstanding between schools and parents, alumni, applicants, and others.</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy Risks</strong></h4>



<p>As personal information has become the subject of a digitized world, the risks of cyber attacks have increasingly posed a threat to data privacy. The data privacy risks have the tendency to cause a data breach when a cybercriminal infiltrates a data source and extracts confidential information. While most data breaches occur due to hacking or malware attacks other methods include accidental data sharing, employee data theft, internet fraud, etc.</p>



<p><strong>The most common data breaches occur due to the following risks:</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Accidental Data Sharing&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Personal data is usually exposed by cybercriminals however, sometimes the company’s own employees accidentally share and misplace consumer’s sensitive data resulting in the data breach. For example in 2018, hundreds of Australian’s personally identifiable information and health information we&#8217;re exposed to the public after an employee accidentally shared some sensitive data with an organizational outsider.</p>



<p><strong>• Employee Data Theft</strong></p>



<p>The data theft by a departing employee is a bigger threat than that of a hacker. It occurs most frequently when an employee leaves or resigns from an organization to work for a competitor or to set up their own rival company. For instance, Levandowski in 2019, stole diagrams and drawings related to simulations, radar technology, and Light Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), source code snippets, PDFs marked as confidential, Videos of test drives, and Marketing information from Google and provided it to Uber.</p>



<p><strong>Most commonly the data theft includes stealing of customer information, financial records, Email list, process document, employees records etc.</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;• Ransomware</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ransomware attacks have been becoming grave as the years pass by. Ransomware is the form of malware that encrypts the victim’s file. The attacker then demands the victim to restore access to data upon payment. In order to retrieve the basic data hostage and to restore affected data, most of the organizations agree to pay the ransom to the attackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;As witnessed in 2019, the ransomware attacks have vastly affected sectors like health care, manufacturing, finance, etc. As a response to this many companies has put forth ransomware prevention as a priority in 2020.</p>



<p><strong>• Bad Password Hygiene&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Account passwords should be such so that they are difficult to guess and harder to crack. An overwhelming number of passwords may lead to poor password hygiene when there is no technology in place to help.</p>



<p>Reusing and sharing of passwords has remained a common practice in most businesses among the employees resulting in countless data breaches and individual account takeovers.</p>



<p>The incidents leading to poor password hygiene may include selecting passwords that are obvious, selecting the same password for each account, temptation to share passwords with others for convenience, and writing down the passwords for easy recall, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Phishing Emails&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A phishing attack is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon to lure the victim with an attempt to obtain sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It manipulates the victims into performing certain actions like clicking on a malicious link or willfully disclosing the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>• Internet Frauds&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The main aim of internet fraud usually is to deceive the victim or to otherwise take advantage of them by stealing the information. such information can be used for financial gain by making fraudulent transactions, draining bank accounts, etc. which may result in significant reputational repercussions and increase the risk of class action lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>one of the oldest internet fraud examples is Nigerian Email scams. Someone from a country (often Nigeria, but not always) contacts you via email in broken English. They explain that a rich person they know has died and the money has nowhere to go; if you can help them get the funds out of the country, they’ll give you some as a reward</p>



<p>The most prominent internet frauds are online shopping frauds, email scams, identity theft, tax scams, lottery frauds, matrimonial frauds, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Bribery&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bribery mostly results in serious data security concern to those companies whose data and intellectual property is incredible of high value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though bribery not being the most convenient way to perpetuate data, however, the officials of a company can be bribed into revealing the company’s confidential data. In 2018, the employees of Amazon were accused of participating in a bribery scheme that compromises customer data, and a year later it was discovered that AT&amp;T employees received bribes to plant malware on the company’s network.</p>



<h4><strong>How important is Data Privacy?</strong></h4>



<p>Data is an incredibly important part of a company’s asset, collecting and sharing of data can be a big business in today’s digital world but for a business to safely and successfully take advantage of data they are collecting, they need to have safeguards in place to ensure that data is under tight lock and consumers are not subject to uninvited surveillance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this age of digital economy, true company value lies in the collected customer data which is an asset, worthy of being protected. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data created and stored continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Any information stored digitally needs to be properly protected right from financial information and payment details to contact information. Data protection is not only a legal necessity but crucial for protecting and maintaining the business also.</p>



<p>Data privacy importance lies in the fact that individuals are able to maintain their autonomy and individuality over how their personal information moves into the economy and society. The right to privacy is the fundamental right of an individual so he is at liberty to protect his data and regulate its use.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Data Privacy Tips</strong>:</p>



<p>While the new decade promised an unexplored revolution in the field of Information Technology which has blurred the lines between the real world and the virtual one, it becomes vital for people to be more concerned about their privacy. </p>



<p><strong>Some tips that may help to create a friendly environment for commerce, learning, and communication are listed as follows;</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Use a Safe Search Engine</strong></p>



<p>It’s possible that sometimes a person can be scammed easily by fake engines leading one to fake pages that look like true intended sites. So if one intends to search an online retailer, instead of searching him through the search engine, one should directly visit the secure https:// page or use the App launched by such retailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>•<strong> Use Two Factor Authentication</strong></p>



<p>Two-factor authentication is a higher level of security process than the single factor authentication method in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. It adds an extra layer of security by making the logins extra secure and difficult for hackers to hack sensitive information. It confirms the identity of a person by using two factors one is the password and the other is the security token or a biometric factor, such as fingerprint or facial scan.</p>



<p>• <strong>Anti-Virus Software&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The updated Anti-virus software program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware can better protect sensitive data from being hacked. It not only safeguards from malicious files and viruses but also helps to protect personal information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Digital Vault</strong></p>



<p>Digital Vault is an online vault that protects the information inside it by securing the data from all major risks over the network. It provides great help in securing all the necessary information like a credit card, social security, driving license, passport numbers, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Safe Wi-Fi Environment</strong></p>



<p>The public wifi is inherently less secure than that of the personal one because the number of connections is not known. One should always avail of the safest security protocol to avoid data theft or privacy issues while on public wifi. For this purpose, one can use a secure VPN that hides the IP address and encrypts the information over the web.</p>



<p>• <strong>Limited Information on Social Media</strong></p>



<p>For the protection of personal data, one should avoid personally identifiable information to be shared on social networking sites which could be later used as answers to security questions. The social media privacy settings should be updated to limit the information collected by different sites and who can see the information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Strong Passwords</strong></p>



<p>One should always create strong passwords by making use of capital letters, lowercase, numbers, special characters and change them often. The stronger the password, the more difficult a threat will be.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>How much are&nbsp;the Countries Concerned?</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1IP5XARUhpT-d-CjaXxDGVOB3hs1R1cuuMRuKqU7L_SCvYVdZ0daDj1IRFkOUcmAeUTB-lu3qY7B0MkFErI5Q17-pVrXWMLy9CMMoAky0bgpDf7FgM_VnstJgF7qFdFYI8umBXM6" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In order to address the data privacy issues like data theft, phishing email attacks, ransomware attacks, etc. almost every country around the Globe has enacted data privacy legislation under their municipal laws. These laws govern the rules and regulations for the collection, storage, and use of collected data in a legitimate manner. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the privacy laws around the world are as follows:</strong></p>



<p>1. <strong>CCPA</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act / USA&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Officially in effect on January 1st, 2020, this legislation demands the companies to inform the user of data processing, take extra measures to protect user information, and allow users a say in what data is collected and how it is shared.</p>



<p><strong>2. CALOPPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The California Online Privacy Protection Act/ USA.</strong></p>



<p>This Act requires commercial websites to post privacy policies detailing data collection and use on their website.</p>



<p><strong>3. CFAA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act/US.</strong></p>



<p>The law prohibits accessing the computer without authorization or excess of authorization in order to reduce the instances of malicious hacking.</p>



<p><strong>4. PIPEDA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act/Canada.</strong></p>



<p>This Act mandates that businesses using data for, or in the course of, commercial activities, must disclose the purpose of that data collection to the owners of that data, and obtain consent to proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. LGPD</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lei Geral de Protèçao de dados Pessoais/ Brazil.</strong></p>



<p>LGPD is landmark legislation outlining data processing standards, including the ten legal bases on which the data can be processed. While the law was modeled after the EU GDPR it is notably less strict.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>PDP</strong></p>



<p><strong>National Directorate of Personal Data Protection/ Argentina.</strong></p>



<p>This law replaced Argentina’s Personal Data Protection Law and it gave users for the first time in Argentina the right to request, the deletion, and transfer of data.</p>



<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>GDPR</strong></p>



<p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation/EU.</strong></p>



<p>It sets the strictest and most far-reaching standards for the handling of user data. It is based on the principles of consent, transparency, protection, and user control, and threatens fines as high as 4% of a company&#8217;s annual revenue.</p>



<p><strong>8. e-Privacy</strong></p>



<p><strong>e-Privacy Directive and Regulation/ EU.</strong></p>



<p>The ePrivacy Directive is often referred to as cookie law due to its requirement that websites obtain user consent to non-essential cookies before launching those cookies.</p>



<p><strong>9. BBSG</strong></p>



<p><strong>Budesdatenschupzgesetz/Germany.</strong></p>



<p>This Law sets rigid standards under which businesses are required to adopt and maintain protective measures for data stored in IT systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>10. POPI</strong></p>



<p><strong>Protection Of Personal Information Act/South Africa.</strong></p>



<p>This Law applies to all South African organizations. It sets a standard of accountability for responsible data processing and establishes the requirement of customer consent to direct marketing outreach.</p>



<p><strong>11. Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018(India).</strong></p>



<p>After the Right to Privacy was determined as a Fundamental Human Right in 2017. India’s first Data Privacy Law was quickly created. The legislation sets privacy and data protection standards and notably introduces mandatory annual data audits.</p>



<p><strong>12. Cyber Security Law (china).</strong></p>



<p>China’s was enacted to increase data protection, data localization, and cybersecurity in the interest of national security.</p>



<p><strong>13. ECPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Electronic Communications Privacy Act/ US.</strong></p>



<p>It prohibits the third party from disclosing private electronic communication without authorization.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Data privacy has generated the attention of the individuals, sharing sensitive personally identifiable information due to the privacy breach incidents which are increasing as the technology is evolving. The collection, transfer, and dissemination of information which usually takes place via the internet, get exposed to a number of risks. For this reason, it generates the attention of the public, academics, government, and the business class which is valuable for the reason that would encourage concern to be shown to the past and future of privacy protection.</p>



<p>Privacy being a fundamental right is an element of a healthy democratic society and a social property which relates to power, culture, values, social standing, liberty, and dignity among other things.</p>



<p>In order to take the account of data privacy risks, though much legislation has been enacted to address these issues, however, there are still incidents of data privacy intrusions for which the countries need to come up with the effective implementation of those legislations. Since there is an alarming rise of data privacy risks leading to data thefts and data breaches, the Legislations alone won’t count so, it’s high time that the information technology industry and government come together to lay down and regulate the effective means and norms to curb the menace of intrusion of privacy.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Human Rights are the basic universal and inalienable rights and fundamental freedom guaranteed to every individual against any inhumane and arbitrary treatment. These are the inherited rights granted equally to all human beings irrespective of ethnicity, nationality, race, color, sex, religion, or otherwise. The basis of Human rights is to treat everyone without any discrimination which includes civil, political, economical, social, and cultural rights in order to keep society equitable.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>These rights are not just abstract concepts but set out the necessary standards for people to live a dignified life. Human rights define the relationship between an individual and country and demands guaranteed protection from any unfair treatment and discrimination. Human Rights set out the choice for subjects to choose their govt. They are free to choose any form of Govt., whether democratic or non-democratic. In democracies, people can easily voice an opinion on their choice of the ruler while in non- democratic countries, it depends on the nature of the will of people to choose their ruler to whom they have submitted their wills.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Origin&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Human rights are thought to have developed differently in different cultures and philosophies. People around the world have different concepts of basic human rights based on their religion, political affiliations, or other factors. Human rights were first seen to originate from religious beliefs. It was believed to be God-given and human beings adopted those beliefs as opposed to natural rights. Later philosophers from early modern Europe like Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke developed new norms and traditions. Natural rights were not seen as merely moral claims but they were considered to reflect the most fundamental human drives leading to truly human existence. By the late eighteenth century, such ideas were used as a means of constraining the government&#8217;s sphere of autonomy as was expressed in the US Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and in the Citizen (1789). It acquired an international dimension when the Congress of Vienna attempted to abolish the slave trade which was eventually achieved by the Brussels Convention (1890) and formally outlawed by the Slavery Convention (1926). The horrendous memories of WWII, especially the “Final Solution” to Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs in the extermination camps of Nazi Germany, established a modern agenda for human rights at the international forums. The UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and human rights violations affected the domestic policies as well as informed the foreign policy decisions of states, which were until then given second class status at the expense of “national security”.</p>



<p>As far as non-democratic states are considered the chances of human rights violations are more given the lack of accountability of the governments towards their respective subjects. There is no system of check and balance, no free press, and no fair trial. This can make the conditions worse for the dissidents as citizens can be penalized on vague charges and face indefinite detention. In some of the non- democratic, authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Venezuela, Jordan, Cuba, Turkmenistan innumerable gross human rights violations have been reported and people are unable to get it redressed till now.</p>



<h4>Social Perception Around The Issue</h4>



<p>According to a Journal Published on “Citizens’ Perceptions of Human Rights Practices: An Analysis of 55 Countries” by Matthew Carlson and Ola Listhaug; The concept of Human Rights is said to be accepted differently in society and there is a limited agreement to what human rights actually means. They gave an example that most scholars accept the argument that Human rights are rights which include civil, political, economic, and social aspects as mentioned under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, they mention that recent global comparisons of human rights practices are likely to be concerned with narrow concepts that focus on ‘individual integrity’ i.e., the right to be free from torture, imprisonment, execution, or disappearance.</p>



<p>Further, it is agreed upon that Citizens of oppressive countries are likely to have more negative perceptions than citizens of countries with more appreciative human rights records and even believed that highly educated individuals are more analytical towards human rights violations in repressive societies than in less repressive societies. It is mentioned that the level of political terror within a country’s age, gender, opinion of an individual, will have a different approach of human rights conditions, depending on their life experiences, opportunities, and the amount of&nbsp;information available to them.</p>



<h4><strong>Non-Democratic Countries And Human Rights Violations Analysis:</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia has a Kingdom of monarchy ruled by King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is both head of state and head of Government. The Government has been responsible for various human rights issues like executions for non-violent offences, forced disappearance, and torture. The people are denied the right to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The Government has harassed, arbitrarily detained, and prosecuted dozens of government critics, activists, including women’s rights activists and members of the Shi’a community.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association and Belief</h4>



<p>Saudi authorities continue to repress free thinkers, human rights activists, and independent clerics. Activists have been sentenced to long term imprisonments for charges arising from their peaceful activism. Four prominent activists—Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sadah, and Nouf Abdulaziz—have been imprisoned and remained in detention without any trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Saudi authorities opened a separate trial of prominent human rights activists, Nassima al-Sadah and Samar Badawi before the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, where charges against them have not been made public. Saudi Arabia does not tolerate public worship by followers of religions other than Islam. Saudi Arabia has no written laws concerning gender identity, and judges use principles of Islamic law to sanction people committing sexual relations outside marriage, adultery, extra-marital affairs, and homosexuality.</p>



<h4>Criminal Justice System</h4>



<p>Saudi Arabia applies Sharia (Islamic law) as its national law. On April 23, 2019, a mass execution of 37 men was carried out in various parts of the country. At least 33 were from the country’s minority Shia community who had been convicted following unfair trials for various alleged crimes, including protest-related offenses, espionage, and terrorism. According to Interior Ministry statements, Saudi Arabia executed 179 persons between January and mid-November for murder and drug crimes. Eighty-one among those executed were convicted for non-violent drug crimes. Executions are carried out by firing squad or beheading, sometimes in public.</p>



<h4>Right Granted in its Entirety </h4>



<p>Women and girls continued to face systematic discrimination in law and in practice in other areas such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and the ability to pass on citizenship to their children.</p>



<p>Shi’a Muslims continued to face discrimination because of their faith, limiting their right to express religious beliefs and access justice, as well as their right to work in a number of public sector professions and access state services.</p>



<p>Some migrant workers suffer abuses and exploitation, sometimes amounting to conditions of forced labor. The kafala (visa sponsorship) system ties migrant workers’ residency permits to “sponsoring” employers, whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country under normal circumstances. Some employers confiscate passports, withhold wages, and force migrants to work against their will.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In China, the human rights condition continues to worsen. The justice system remains in trouble because of unfair trials, torture, and ill-treatment during detention. LGBTI people face widespread discrimination and stigma in society. Due to inadequate medical services, they take serious risks by seeking unregulated and improper gender-affirming treatments. LGBTI people also face abuses in the form of “conversion therapy”.</p>



<p>The government continues to intimidate, harass, and prosecute human rights defenders and independent NGOs, by raiding their homes and offices. Even the family members of the activists are being harassed and detained. They are put under police surveillance and restrained from any movement.</p>



<h4><strong>J</strong>ustice System</h4>



<p>President Xi Jinping proposes to bring the legal system under the ambit of the Chinese Communist Party’s absolute leadership. Law enforcement and the judicial system remains largely under the control of the party. China has legalized arbitrary and secret detention, such as “residential surveillance in a designated location” and an extrajudicial system of detention (Liuzzi). These plans allow for solitary confinement which increases the risk of torture and other ill-treatment.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Religion and Belief</h4>



<p>The government has strengthened its restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. The authorities rigorously censor all media, from print media to online games.</p>



<p>Chinese authorities continue to tighten its grip on Christians and Muslims as China pushes ahead with the “sanitization of religion”, with a view to combating any religious activity. Many Buddhist and Taoist temples and statues, along with mosques and churches, are being damaged or destroyed at the direction of the government. There are various reports about the detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups continued in Xinjiang in “vocational training centers”, also known as “transformation-through-education” centers. An estimated up to one million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minority people were sent to concentration camps. Many religious figures, intellectuals, and academics have been detained in Xinjiang merely for exercising their rights to freedom of religion and expression.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>LGBTI people continue to face discrimination at home, at work, in schools, and in public. The authorities accept and claim to have implemented all recommendations on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression at the end of the country’s review process in the third cycle of the UN Universal Periodic Review in 2018. Two recommendations requested prohibition against discrimination in legislation, but there is no law that explicitly protects LGBTI people from discrimination.</p>



<p>The Human Rights defenders (HRDs) have been unable to commit to their work without any interference from the Government. The authorities systematically subject them to surveillance, harassment, intimidation, detention, and imprisonment. Many activists and HRDs continue to be prosecuted on vague and overly broad charges such as “subverting state power”, “inciting subversion of state power” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. Many are held in “residential surveillance in a designated location” on suspicion of involvement in state security crimes. This form of detention allows the police to detain individuals suspected of such crimes for up to six months in an unknown location outside the formal detention system, with suspects denied access to legal counsel and families.</p>



<h4><strong>Jordan</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A woman raises a Jordanian national flag as she stands amidst public school teachers demonstrating and demanding pay raises at the Professional Associations Complex in Jordan&#8217;s capital, Amman, on 3 October 2019. </strong></p>



<p>The authorities detain journalists and activists critical of the government or the King, demonstrators for demanding their and others’ release, as well as block websites of activists abroad.&nbsp; Jordan is a member of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the armed conflict in Yemen.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression and Assembly</h4>



<p>In February 2019,&nbsp; parliament’s lower house refused to enact a draft of cybercrime law presented by the government on the basis that the definitions were vague and that some provisions contradicted the penal code; the definition of hate speech was overly broad and risked severely curtailing freedom of expression. The authorities have blocked access to websites set up by Jordanian activists abroad seeking to record political developments and arrests of activists in Jordan. The authorities harass and detain activists and journalists who criticize the government or King Abdullah. Public protests organised without permission are stopped with arrest and detentions and demonstrators are made to sign a pledge that they would refrain from participating in the future.</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>Administrative detention against women is used usually for months and for discriminatory reasons, such as for being “absent from home” without a male guardian’s permission, or for having sex outside marriage (Zina), begging, or homeless. Women who become pregnant outside marriage face authoritarian detention and forcible abortion.</p>



<p>Citizenship laws of Jordan are biased against children of Jordanian mothers and non-Jordanian fathers, who, contrary to children of Jordanian fathers marry non-Jordanians, are denied Jordanian citizenship.</p>



<p>The Family Protection Department and the Ministry of Social Development continue to forcibly abort the babies from unmarried women, without consideration of the best interests of the child and mother.</p>



<p>Migrant domestic workers have been facing abuse by their employers and agents, and remain at risk of arbitrary detention by the state. They are detained after fleeing their employer&#8217;s residence without permission. Those under-privileged who seek work in order to earn money need attention from the state for their upliftment.</p>



<h4><strong>North Korea</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A commuter reads a newspaper while waiting for a train at a newsstand in a subway station in Pyongyang on June 19, 2019, ahead of a visit to the North Korean capital by Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 20. Xi will be the first Chinese leader to visit Pyongyang in 14 years. </strong></p>



<p>North Korea is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world with Kim Jong Un serving as head of government and ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, uses threats of execution, arbitrary punishment of crimes, detention, and forced labor to maintain fearful obedience. It continues restrictions on travel outside the country and incommunicado with the outside world.</p>



<p>The government doesn’t tolerate dissent. It has banned independent media, civil society, and trade unions, The Regime also schematically denies basic rights, including freedom of expression, association, and religion. It systematically extracts forced, unpaid labor from its citizens to build infrastructure and implement public projects. The government also fails to protect or promote the rights of numerous at-risk groups, including women, children, and people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2014 United Nations Commission of Inquiry (COI) report on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea)&nbsp; briefed that the government has committed crimes against humanity, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, and forced abortion. It recommended the UN Security Council refer the situation to the International Criminal Court.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Rights Granted in its Entirety</h4>



<p>In 2019, Kim Jong Un’s government barred people from leaving North Korea without a permit, by blocking Chinese mobile phone services at the border, aiming to arrest those communicating with people outside the country or trying to leave, and broadcasting punishments imposed on persons caught escaping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The North Korean government systematically requires forced, uncompensated labor from most of its population—including workers at state-owned enterprises or deployed overseas, women, children, and prisoners—to control its people and sustain its economy. A majority of North Koreans are supposed to perform unpaid labor, often called “portrayals of loyalty” at some time in their lives. North Korea is one of the only seven UN member states that has not joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) and during the Universal Periodic Review, the government did not accept recommendations. This also goes against equality and ethical standards of treatment of labours.</p>



<h4><strong>Vietnam</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Environmental activist Nguyen Ngoc Anh (c) stands in a courtroom in June 2019 during his trial in Vietnam’s Ben Tre province, in which he was sentenced to six years in prison for “undermining” the government via his Facebook posts.</strong></p>



<p>In Vietnam, the Government has been committing various inhumane acts against human rights activists and has actively breached a number of human rights resolutions.</p>



<h4>Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly</h4>



<p>Government has arbitrarily put restrictions on uploading content on Google, Youtube, and other online platforms. Media-censorship, limiting content, ads, and any news which is politically sensitive is termed as fake news. A court in Dong Nai sentenced two Facebook users, Vu Thi Dung and Nguyen Thi Ngoc Suong, to six years and five years’ imprisonment respectively, for reading and listening to materials on Facebook and distributing leaflets calling on people to protest against China and state oppression. They were charged with possessing materials “that aim to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam”.</p>



<p>Vietnam has banned the formation of independent labor unions, human rights organizations, and political parties. Those who dare to establish workers&#8217; unions face harassment, intimidation, and retribution. Labor activist Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung was imprisoned for helping to organize a strike in Tra Vinh province in 2010. Police immediately placed him under intrusive surveillance. Even after ratifying International Labor Convention 98 on collective bargaining and the right to organize unrecognized religious groups, Christian, and Buddhist groups face constant harassment and intimidation from the government. Followers of independent religious groups are subjected to public criticism, forced renunciation of faith, detention, interrogation, torture, and imprisonment.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Despite ratifying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various other human rights treaties, these states have been found grossly violating them and committing human rights violations on its citizens. Right to life, liberty, freedom of expression, right to dissent, protest, freedom of the press is being violated day in and day out. In order to bring justice and promote human rights, international communities and organisations need to put pressure on these states to amend laws, investigate crimes, and bring perpetrators to justice in courts.</p>



<p>There is an immense need for positive change vis a vis human rights, especially in authoritarian non-democratic states because the human rights situation continues to remain grim. Especially we can say this in the post- COVID 19 world because the governments all over the world are stepping into the sphere of individual rights and the states, in the facade of controlling the disease, are actively using intrusive surveillance techniques. There is also a role to play for human rights organisations to make the general population in non-democratic countries aware of the importance of human rights and put pressure on their respective governments so that every individual irrespective of his race, gender, religion, or ethnicity gets to live a life that is free from fear, intimidation or harassment.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The doctrine of humanitarian intervention is one of the most contested issues in the world today. It is both widely accepted and yet still highly controversial.</p>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention poses significant challenges and raises a number of questions that give rise to an ongoing debate in regard to the current international legal framework.</p>



<p>The article considers whether humanitarian intervention is legal under international law. This is a common question but produces an undecided answer: humanitarian intervention appears to contradict the United Nations Charter, but developments in state practice since 1945might have made it legal under certain circumstances.</p>



<p>Some scholars see it as a legal right for states in some situations, whereas others argue that in all situations humanitarian intervention is an illegal act.</p>



<p>The debate suggests that humanitarian intervention is either legal or illegal depending on one’s understanding of how international law is constructed, changed, and represented.</p>



<h4><strong>Definition</strong></h4>



<p>It is difficult to construe a unifying definition of humanitarian intervention. Humanitarian intervention has been defined differently by different scholars.</p>



<p>For example, humanitarian intervention has been defined by Wil Verwey as:</p>



<p>“The threat or use of force by a state or states abroad, for the sole purpose of preventing or putting a halt to a serious violation of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to life of persons, regardless of their nationality, such protection taking place neither upon authorization by relevant organs of the United Nation no with permission by the legitimate government of the target state.”</p>



<p><strong>T.D Gill defines humanitarian intervention</strong> as, &#8220;The humanitarian intervention is the military activity by one or more States – irrespective of whether they are part of a military alliance or regional organization – aimed at putting an end to or protecting persons, not of its(their) nationality who are subjected to serious violations of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to life, without the consent of the target State and without any form of authorization by the UN Security Council&#8221;.</p>



<h4><strong>Characteristics of Humanitarian Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>Some of the essential characteristics of humanitarian intervention are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>A humanitarian intervention involves the threat and use of military forces as a central feature.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>It is an intervention in the sense that it entails interfering in the internal affairs of a state by sending military forces into the territory or airspace of a sovereign state that has not committed an act of aggression against another state.</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li>The intervention is in response to situations that do not necessarily pose direct threats to states&#8217; strategic interests but instead are motivated by humanitarian objectives.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>



<p>Getting involved in the affairs of another state on humanitarian grounds has been a subject of discussion in public international law since the 19th century.</p>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention was born out of predominantly three humanitarian catastrophes during the Nineties, namely Rwanda, Srebrenica, and Kosovo. In each of these instances, the UN was notably absent from taking action, which led to either a humanitarian crisis occurring or another body having to take action out with the law to prevent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The first catastrophe that led to the call for humanitarian intervention was the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. In the space of approximately 100 days, over half a million Tutsis were killed by the Hutu government and a further two million sought refuge in neighboring countries. This happened despite the presence of a UN peacekeeping mission, UNAMIR(United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda)on the ground. The UNAMIR, however, did not have a robust mandate and thus was not authorized to use force by the UNSC so it could do very little to prevent the attacks, especially when their numbers were actually reduced over this period.</p>



<p>Shortly after the genocide in Rwanda came a massacre of Bosnian Muslim males in Srebrenica in 1995. Because of greater fighting in the former Yugoslavia the UN created safe areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995 and the UN Protection Force was given the task of defending them. However, after Serb forces attacked the safe areas, the peacekeeping force was unable to do anything to stop it, as again UNSC had not authorized them to use force. This resulted in the killing of approximately 7,000 Muslim men. This situation, along with that of Rwanda, highlighted the real need for the international community to step up and help people in these situations, particularly if the UNSC is unable or refuses to act.</p>



<p>This is why in the case of Kosovo in 1999, the world saw a different outcome. When the UNSC refused to take any action to combat the persecution of Kosovar Albanians from the FRY(Yugoslavian army)due to continued opposition from Russia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) stepped in and began a series of aerial strikes in the name of humanitarian intervention. This action by NATO was illegal under international law as the organization did not have UNSC authorization to use force charter and it could not be classed as self-defense as a NATO member state had not been attacked. However, it was widely agreed that the intervention was ‘illegal but legitimate’ due to the humanitarian purposes it was trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Use of force</strong></h4>



<p>International law is fundamentally concerned with regulating war between states, and well-developed bodies of law exist on state conduct in war and the decision to use force.</p>



<p>In order to understand the legal basis of humanitarian intervention, it is very important to know the laws related to the use of force by states under the UN Charter. It takes two contributions that are elementary to today’s legal regime on war: it outlaws the use of force on part of individual states, and it empowers the Security Council to make all decisions on collective measures that involve military force.</p>



<ol><li>Article 2(4) establishes the first element and it requires that states not use or threaten force against other states: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This is a general prohibition, set in the section of the Charter that defines the common and fundamental obligations of UN members and of the organization itself, and it is often cited as the primary contribution of the UN system to international order. It goes along with Article2 (3), which insists that UN members settle their interstate disputes by “peaceful means.</li><li>Articles 24,39 and 42 deliver the power to use force to the Security Council. These sections of the Charter establish that the Council has the “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security” (Article 24 ) and that it can take all measures it deems necessary in that pursuit, including military action against states or other threats (Article 42 ).</li></ol>



<p>Therefore, having all these articles in the background we may conclude that the use of force is not allowed unless all other peaceful resources have been taken by states and if such recourse fails then only use of force is permitted. In other words, whether the use of force is permitted or not will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Legal basis and justification of Humanitarian intervention</strong></h4>



<p>The advocates of intervention put forward two types of arguments.&nbsp;Firstly, humanitarian intervention is directed neither at the territorial integrity nor the political independence of the targeted State and is not thus inconsistent with Art. 2(4).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the Charter is not an instrument protecting only a single value, that is peace at all costs, but it has in fact several purposes to which it gives expression. No doubt one of its fundamental values is the prohibition of the use of force, but it cannot be ignored that another is the protection of fundamental human rights. Thus, in cases of grave conflict between the maintenance of peace and respect for human rights, the proponents hold that sovereignty and non-recourse to force have to yield to humanitarian imperatives. In other words, there is a duty, at least in the most extreme cases, to strike a balance between “conflict-minimization and the protection of human rights.” Finally, a practical argument which has emotional and moral overtones and is thus, more compelling: <em>must the international community stand idly by while millions of human beings are being massacred just because in the SC a permanent member holds its protective hand over the culprit?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>UN Charter&#8217;s prohibition of use of force is not absolute </strong></h4>



<p>The use of force is only prohibited under Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter when it goes against “territorial integrity and political independence”.<sup> </sup>As a “genuine humanitarian intervention does not result in territorial conquest or political subjugation. It is a distortion to argue that [it] is prohibited by Art. 2(4).” The reference in Art. 2(4) to the “Purposes of the UN”, excludes any prohibition on humanitarian intervention as a <em>bona fide</em> humanitarian intervention is consistent with the purposes of the UN.</p>



<p>Furthermore<sup> &nbsp; </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 1(3) of the UN Charter states one of the purposes is “to achieve international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms”. As the humanitarian intervention is not contrary to these purposes, it is arguably still consistent with Art. 2(4).</p>



<p>Humanitarian intervention is permissible where the UN fails to fulfill its task of safeguarding human rights, as surely the drafters of the Charter did not intend states to merely do anything where serious human rights violations are occurring. Genocide Convention (1948) states that parties must “prevent and punish” the “crime of genocide” allows for humanitarian intervention where genocide is being committed. The ICJ opinion in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)—the Genocide Case, was “the obligation of States parties is rather to employ all means reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible”. It can be asserted using Wesley Hohfeld’s jural correlative that given the positive duty upon states to prevent genocide, which was reiterated in the Genocide Convention Case, there must be a correlative right of peoples to be protected, and in the case of genocide where there are no realistic means of exercising this right, the right to intervene must be vested in other states.</p>



<h4><strong>Interpretation of Provisions</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention<sup> </sup>provides that treaty provisions shall be interpreted in light of the treaty’s object and purpose. This is a crucial point often missed by strict constructionists. Art. 31(2) of the Vienna Convention<sup> </sup>then explains that the object and purpose of a treaty are determined, <em>inter alia</em>, by looking at the treaty’s preamble. The preamble of the UN Charter provides that its members reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person.<em> </em>In <em>Nuclear Weapons Case</em>, ICJ Judge Weeramantry noted that “dignity and worth of the human person” are keynote principles of the UN Charter.</p>



<p>Pursuant to the Vienna Convention, the provisions of the UN Charter (including Art. 2(4)’s prohibition on the use of force) must be interpreted in conformity with the purposes of the UN Charter. These purposes specifically include the promotion and protection of human rights. It is important to note that Art. 2(4) speaks of conduct inconsistent with the <em>purposes </em>of the Charter, not necessarily with the provisions of the Charter.</p>



<p>Also, the preamble of the Rome Statute acknowledges that during this century millions of children, women, and men have been victims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity and that such grave crimes threaten the peace, security, and well-being of the world.</p>



<p>Art. 2(4) cannot be interpreted to abrogate the very purposes of the Charter, especially its human rights provisions, or to deprive Articles 1, 55, 56, and the preamble of any meaning. Therefore, the article cannot be construed to prohibit <em>bona fide </em>humanitarian intervention necessary to enforce the principles of the Charter even if force is unauthorized by the SC.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>And the preamble also provides that an additional purpose of the Charter is “to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law<em> </em>can be maintained.”<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<h4><strong>Humanitarian intervention has achieved the status of&nbsp; customary international law </strong></h4>



<p>Customary international law is one component of international law. Customary international law refers to international obligations arising from established international practices, as opposed to obligations arising from formal written conventions and treaties. Customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of states that they follow from a sense of legal obligation.</p>



<p>Customary law is formed each time an international incident occurs, based on the way the international community reacts.<sup> </sup>A resolution put before the SC condemning the NATO bombing in Serbia was defeated by 12 votes to three, implying acceptance of the action as legal.<sup> </sup>This theory of the formation of new customary legal norms may well justify the Kosovo operation by way of hindsight; because nobody did anything to stop it or oppose it, then the law may have embraced it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many other precedents also which give the legal basis of humanitarian intervention and thus paving it&#8217;s way to the status of customary international law for example UK/US no-fly zone imposed over Southern Iraq from 1991 to 2003, US attack against ISIS, UK/US/France airstrikes against Syria&#8217;s chemical weapon facilities in 2018, etc. All these interventions were claimed to be done on a humanitarian basis to prevent crises. Therefore from all the above examples, we may derive that Humanitarian intervention has achieved the status of customary international law.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>The Responsibility To Protect</strong></h4>



<p>The norm of non-intervention must give way when a State commits genocide or crimes against humanity on its own territory. This approach was first reflected in a report by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (‘ICISS’). ICISS was created after the Kosovo intervention under the support of the Canadian government and a group of private foundations in response to appeals by Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, produced a detailed Report<sup> </sup>on humanitarian intervention entitled “The Responsibility to Protect”. The Commission recognized that the responsibility to protect its people from killing and other grave harm was the most basic and fundamental of all the responsibilities that sovereignty imposes—and pursuant to this doctrine if a state cannot or will not protect its people from such harm, then coercive intervention for human protection purposes, including ultimately military intervention, by others in the international community may be justified in extreme cases.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>The Commission then goes on to state the conditions under which the interests of protection prevail. For an intervention to be lawful there must be:</p>



<ol><li>a just cause;</li><li>the right intention (<em>recta intention</em>);&nbsp;</li><li>a situation of last recourse (<em>ultima ratio</em>);&nbsp;</li><li>respect for the principle of proportionality;&nbsp;</li><li>reasonable prospects of success;&nbsp;</li><li>a prior request for authorization by the SC of the action.</li></ol>



<p>For the just cause (a.), it is clearly stated that only a grave and irreparable harm for human beings, i.e. considerable losses of human lives (actual or expected) or ethnic cleansing on a large scale can give rise to a right of military intervention.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>As for the “right intention” (b.), the Commission stresses that the essential aim of the intervention must be to halt or avert human suffering<em>.</em><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Further, the intervention must be the last recourse (c.), i.e. all diplomatic and other non-military means must previously have been explored. It is not necessary for all ways to have been actually tried and proved unsuccessful; it is, however, necessary to establish there were reasonable grounds for believing that, in the circumstances, the measure, if attempted, would not have been successful, e.g., by reason of lack of time.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Moreover, the intervention must be proportionate (d.) in scope, duration, and intensity to the humanitarian aim pursued, which means that the force used must be the minimum necessary to accomplish the aim.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>



<p>Finally, the criterion of reasonable prospects of success of the operation (e.) requires there must be a reasonable chance of success in halting or averting the suffering which has justified the intervention, with the consequences of action not likely to be worse than the consequences of inaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore whether there was a bonafide humanitarian intervention or not must be checked out under the above references.</p>



<p>Besides as already mentioned, the preamble of the UN Charter also provides that an additional purpose of the Charter is “to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.” The Responsibility to Protect the norm, which is one of those other sources, holds that states have a fundamental duty to protect their people from serious and systematic human rights abuses. The GA, offering strong evidence of opinion Juris, explained, “Each individual state has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity through appropriate and necessary means and, if a state cannot or will not prevent the occurrence of such abuses, then the intervention by other actors in the international community is justified.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>The concept of humanitarian intervention is very important. Although a group of propounders does not consider it legal to intervene in the affairs of other states there is enough legal basis, as explained above to justify humanitarian intervention. How can a part of the world ignore all the atrocities and human killings and violations in some other part of the world, turn its back, and live a luxurious life? It is against the basic moral character of humans to let a population in some people of the world die on their own just because international law is not expressly allowing it.</p>



<p>The need of the hour is that the UN should expressly provide some laws to authorize humanitarian intervention in the parts of the world where it is gravely needed. Until then the world should take recourse to the broad interpretation of the UN Charter and Customary International law to intervene in other states on humanitarian grounds to prevent and protect human atrocities in any part of the world.</p>



<p>But at the same time, it has to be taken care of that any superpower or developed state should not intervene in an underdeveloped State for their own benefits and agendas on the pretext of humanitarian intervention.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>In India, no doubt there are special laws relating to children but still, they are deprived of even basic human rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of India and other legislation. In India, the problem of child labour is quite alarming. As per Census 2011, the total child population in India in the age group (5-14) years is 259.6 million. Of these, 10.1 million (3.9% of total child population) are working, either as ‘main worker’ or as ‘marginal worker’. In addition, more than 42.7 million children in India are out of school. [i]</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Child labour deprives the child of an opportunity for education, play, and recreation. It affects physical growth, normal development, and prevents their preparation for responsibility. There are a number of risks that are experienced by working children. The worst effect of child labour is that it interferes with the education of the children which decreases their vocational development. They neither acquire any skill nor receive any education as a result they remain illiterate and oppressed. Most of all it gives birth to a number of economic problems such as the use of labour at its lowest productivity implying thereby an inefficient utilization of labor-power.</p>



<p>The most affected aspect of working children is their health. The working children are more vulnerable to tuberculosis and bronchitis, muscle atrophy, weakening and malformation of bones, eye diseases, stunted growth, finger arthritis, damage to fingernails, and malnutrition.</p>



<p>The worst forms of child labour which include slavery and similar practices like trafficking, forced labour, etc. have severe effects on children like depression, premature aging, malnutrition, and drug dependency. It endangers the child‘s dignity and morals. It endangers their innocence.</p>



<h4><strong>Constitutional Safeguards in India for Children</strong></h4>



<p>Keeping in view the gigantic problem of child labour, the Indian Parliament enacted appropriate laws for protecting children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is, in a way, likely to be hazardous or harmful to their health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. The Constitution of India has enough provisions in this regard.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Article 15(3)</strong> of the Constitution authorizes the state for making any special provision for women and children. </li><li><strong>Article 21 </strong>provides, no person shall be deprived of his life or his personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. </li><li><strong>Article 21A</strong> says the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6-14 years in such manners as the State may, by law, determine. </li><li><strong>Article 23</strong> says traffic in human beings and the beggar and other forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this position shall be an offense punishable in accordance with the law. </li><li>Under <strong>Article 24</strong> no child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. </li><li><strong>Article 39(E)</strong> says the State shall make its policy towards securing the health and strengths and the tender age of children are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength. Article 39 (E) enjoins that childhood and youth are to be protected against exploitation, against moral and material abandonment. </li><li>In <strong>Article 45</strong> the Constitution provides free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years. </li><li>The general provisions under<strong> Article 38, 42, 43, 45, and 47 of Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>, although do not deal directly with child welfare but provide a strategy for indirectly promoting the welfare of children.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Legislative Provisions for Protection of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Notwithstanding the abovementioned constitutional provisions, there are a number of enactments in the country which protect and safeguard the interests of child labour.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Factories Act of 1881</strong> was the first law to define children and to prescribe prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 7 years of age. The Factories Act, 1911 prohibited employment of children in dangerous occupations and working during night hours. The first Convention of International Labour Organisation (ILO), compelled amendment of the Act in 1922, to raise the minimum age of a child to 15 years. However, children below the age of 12 years were prohibited from employment. The age rose to 13 years in 1935 under the Act. </li><li><strong>The Factories Act, 1948</strong>, prescribes prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 14 years of age in any factory. </li><li><strong>India Mines Act, 1952 </strong>prohibits employment of children below 16 years in any underground mines.</li><li><strong>Plantation Labour Act, 1951 </strong>prohibits employment less than the age of 12 years<strong>. </strong></li><li><strong>The Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961 </strong>absolutely prohibits the employment of children in motor transport. </li><li><strong>The Shops and Commercial Establishments Acts of different States, </strong>also prohibit employment of children in the shops, hotels, dhabas, street shops, and commercial places. </li><li><strong>Besides the above legislations, The Apprentice Act, 1961, </strong>The Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966, The Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 provide that employment of children is a punishable offense. </li></ul>



<p>As required by ILO Convention and as envisaged in the National Seminar on Employment of Children in 1975, to prevent exploitation of children, the Indian Government felt to enact a single Act to deal with the prohibition of child labour.</p>



<h4><strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act</strong></h4>



<p>To provide uniformity of age and to prescribe stricter punishments, the Indian Parliament enacted a single Act to deal with the exploitation of children,<em> i.e.</em>, <strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986</strong>. The Act prohibited the employment of children below the age of 14 years in certain occupations and processes. These include the transport of passengers, goods, and mails and other hazardous work in railways and ports, the process like Beedi making, cement manufacturing, manufacturing of matches and explosives, mica cutting, soap manufacturing, wool cleaning, and building and construction industries. The Act also provides for regulations of conditions of work by prescribing minimum working hours, prohibiting work at night, prohibiting overtime work, and weekly holiday. Also, the Act provides measures for the health and safety of child workers. It emphasized the maintenance of a register having details of children if employed by any organization. Indirect support was extended for such an evil practice which should be totally prohibited irrespective of the nature of employment. <strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012</strong>, has several features that are child-centered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Act tried to fill the gaps which existed due to earlier Acts. However, this Act also proved to be ineffective in curbing the problem. As per UNICEF (2011), the number of child labourers in India is 10.1 million of which 5.6 million are boys and 4.5 million are girls [ii]. Thus, with modernization, the Government of India tried to keep pace with changing times where child labour has included many other forms of exploitation and the government brought an amendment in 2016 which brought many changes in the Act. Some major changes were –</p>



<ul><li>While the original act allowed the employment of children above 14 years in hazardous occupations and processes, the Amendment banned the employment of children at such places up to the age of 18 years.</li><li>The Amendment calls for stricter punishments for violations.</li><li>While the Act prohibited the employment of children up to 14 years in specified categories such as domestic work, automobile workshops, and other hazardous industries; the Amendment gives certain exceptions where the children of such age are allowed to work, like in sporting activities but only in non-school hours and without a subordinate relationship of work and labour. The government justified the exceptions to strike a balance between the need for education for children and the reality of the socio-economic condition and social fabric in the country. But, this Amendment was criticized for taking away the basic protections for some of the most vulnerable workers, and some well-known child rights activists while criticizing the new Amendment say that it permits children to be confined to work instead of being in school because allowing children to work before and after school creates an imbalance in their lives and the children cannot be expected to do multi-tasks at such a tender age and as a result, they are forced to give up their education.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>C</strong>hallenges</h4>



<p>Despite such legislation and rights guaranteed by the Constitution, India continues to be among the countries which have the highest percentage of child labour. The main reasons for this are the economic condition of India, the imbalance that exists in its societies, and most of all the weak implementation mechanisms. In addition to these reasons are, namely:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Poverty &#8211;</strong> It is the single important reason for child labour. The poor parents in order to supplement their income allow the children to work even on unremunerative jobs. Abject poverty and unemployment force the children to take up unremunerative jobs. Thus, economic compulsions weigh heavily on the consciousness of the poor parents and they would not mind colluding with their children’s employers in violating the laws and putting their children under the risks of inhuman exploitation. Parents want their children to earn for themselves as early as possible, much better, if they become a source of income to the family. </li></ul>



<p>Even the highest court of the country has observed that the child labour in India is purely on account of economic reasons that the parents often want their children to be employed to augment their meager earnings and this problem cannot be solved by mere legislation because of the poverty and destitution in the country. In order to eradicate this problem, it is essential that a child should have been able to receive proper education with a view to equipping itself to become a useful member of society and to play a constructive role in the socio-economic development of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Loss of an earning member of the family.</li><li>The poor conviction rate of the violators.</li><li>Many employers prefer to engage children because they are cheap. Moreover, children tend to be less troublesome, more disciplined, and highly adaptable.</li><li>Absence of any state-sponsored scheme of family allowance.</li><li>Nonexistence of any general scheme of compulsory education up to a minimum age.</li><li>The evasion of existing laws for the protection of children.</li><li>Even the social structure system is responsible for child labour as the social structure is characterized by the caste system. The members of the low castes and down-trodden communities are expected to be for the services of the upper castes and thus, they are deprived of their aspirations.</li></ul>



<p>The problem of child labour in India is deeply rooted in the exploitative socio-economic set-up and poor and backward economy. Ignorance by people, lack of opportunities, and other socio-economic institutions add to this problem.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>No doubt there are a number of legislations and constitutional safeguards for child welfare to overcome child labour and to avoid the situations that come as a consequence of child labour. At an international level, different organizations are also working for the same cause. But still, there are a lot of efforts needed to create an environment that is free from child abuse. The instances discussed in the various sections of the writing indicate how far India is in eradicating child labour and how hard work it needs to do for the welfare of the poor, ignorant, and unheard children. The problem lies in the implementation side. The States should devise effective mechanisms for the proper implementation of laws. The more responsibility lies on the parents who should not force their children to indulge in such occupations. Awareness building programs shall be conducted with parents and communities through which people at large can understand the ill-effects of child labour. This problem needs the support of every person in the society and we should discourage the people to employ children in factories, homes, shops, etc. and the initiatives of the civil societies also need to be appreciated.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Terrorism has been a major issue in the Philippines for decades altogether, ranking ninth among the countries most affected by terrorism. Both communist, nationalist rebels and Islamic separatist insurgencies have put havoc on the nation. As a result of which, thousands of Filipinos have been killed in bombings, assassinations, kidnapping attempts, and executions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to address this issue, in June 2020, the House of Representatives in the Philippines passed a bill called Anti-Terrorism Bill. The current President of the Philippines, namely, Rodrigo Duterte certified this bill as an ‘urgent’ one, with the aim to respond to the threat in the country. However, this bill has been subject to a lot of criticism, demonstrations, and protests among politicians, religious organizations, civilians, and celebrities as well. They believe that the Anti-Terrorism Bill will infringe human rights and other civil liberties in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines is a South Asian Archipelagic State. It is the unitary Presidential Constitutional Republic, where the President acts both as the head of State and of Government.</p>



<h4><strong>Current Legal Scenario</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>What is Anti- Terrorism Act?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The Anti-Terrorism Bill was sent by Presidential Spokesperson for the President’s assent and was signed into Action by the president on the 3rd of July. It aims to protect the country from Domestic and Foreign Terrorist Attacks. The Act states that “any law enforcer to arrest and detain without warrant ‘a person suspected of committing any of the acts’ punishable under the major for 14 calendar days, extendable by 10 days and the suspected “terrorists” can also be placed under surveillance for 60 days, extendable by up to 30 more days, by the police or military”. This Act also removed the provision of the previous Act which provided that the acquitted suspects who were arrested without a warrant to recover damages from the police for every day that he or she was detained. Further, the new Act regulates discourse of terrorism that, in the Philippines, the government uses to invalidate dissent, which is coming from Leftists and Communists.<img loading="lazy" width="602" height="400" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UB-pZrP977zHkLQNZPZ8dnkqE3cWg86oXPME8wrJW1bjcqDmfBdspmNuhYT9kFQnhtdtHb60YzLVdxldH7FYVfKT16iRSrzUn9cVJ5MaGIMZMdQuEBGMA3pTQUdQfGG6c47KIg"></p>



<p>It had never been seen in the history of the Philippine that the government authorized police to use such power over commoners. Also, police were earlier at least considering the consequences of arresting suspects without reason. But, now the police do not need to consider the same.</p>



<p><strong>According to the new Act, anyone among the following can be labeled as a ‘terrorist’:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Who engages in acts intended to cause death or serious physical injury to another person.</li><li>Who engages in acts intended to cause extensive damage to a government or public facility, place, or private property.</li><li>Who engages in acts intended to damage critical infrastructure.</li><li>Who develops, possesses, acquires, transports, or uses deadly explosive weapons.</li><li>Who releases dangerous substances, causes fire or floods with the aim to intimidate the public, government, or International organization.&nbsp;</li><li>Who is accused of inciting, conspiring, proposing, and participating in training, planning, and facilitation of terrorist attacks?</li></ol>



<p>Moreover, the Court of Appeals can declare any individual or organization as ‘terrorists’ in 72 hours, upon application from the Department of Justice. Those found guilty will be imprisoned for life without Parole.</p>



<p>As long as advocacy, work stoppages, and humanitarian action is done “without intention to cause physical harm or death to a person, to endanger a person’s life, or to create a serious risk to public safety”; they are exempted from the definition of terrorism. The attributability for law enforcement agents has also been relaxed, who may breach the rights of the accused, particularly those in detention.</p>



<h4><strong>Why was this Act Needed?</strong></h4>



<p>The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 is the amended version of the Human Security Act, which was enacted by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2007, in order to tackle militants in the Southern Philippines. The Act has been put forth in order to battle Asia’s longest Communist insurgency, by the Communist Party of the Philippines, known as the New People’s Army (NPP), and a thirty years reign of terror by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). In 2017, Marawi, a Southern city of the Philippines was subjected to siege by Islamic state-aligned militants. Even, last year the Southern region of the country was jolted by a suicide bombing, allegedly conducted by a militant group known as Islamic State in Sulu (IS Sulu). </p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="286" height="190" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WeM1OIAMWVgrWNRNoOS0Mjr0RA8eYJnQuzIxUVeeoE8qSzyUIl6vGFLrY1IDapvaGfHMpcR9JfOoUp2mRAfDwhgw4wwSr3DTR0sv6JQcAO5-nczCnm6Ys9IQeE84BLiBQoXLJQ"></p>



<p><em>These insurgencies have adversely affected the economic sector in the countryside, hampered investments, and have resulted in cross-fires</em>.</p>



<p>Lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic also did not stop the terror, as reported that more than 6,000 people were evacuated from the country&#8217;s southern region. Where, Communist rebels’ and Islamic militants attacked soldiers, who were securing distribution of financial aid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proponents of the Act are of the opinion that due to the leniency for the offenders and a lot of restrictions on the law enforcer, the previous act has not been efficient enough to curb terrorism. Further, the Act provides the administration with immense power to deal with these security challenges. It expands the range of punishable acts to include preparatory and mobilization activities for the commission of terrorism. &nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="578" height="420" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tyRjXWxgyeRVSDnD4GZjUgACXLp1cbWZsP8h3IQrtDZ7FOhSyhuagVIAD2dPUWwV_wcUi6vXa7JMT7CsH0FxvdL2MlAQEBOoo5yJLbU0lWRRxse59ItCFsIpvXkI08WjYUuIhw"></p>



<h4><strong>Why is this Act a Problem?</strong></h4>



<p>The new Anti-Terrorism Act is opposed because of the following reasons:</p>



<ul><li>The Philippines Commission on Human Rights is of the opinion that the wide definition of terrorism in the new Act makes a way for possible abuse. Critics of the Act pointed to a recent example where the government used the force of law against civilians who were voicing displeasure over dealing with coronavirus by the administration as proof that Duterte’s government could misuse this vague definition.&nbsp;</li><li>Anti-Terrorism council which will be made up of top cabinet officials has been set up by the government in order to define what constitutes terrorism. This council can designate anyone and everyone as a terrorist.&nbsp;</li><li>The act may be a step for amelioration; however, the timing is not. It is a well-known fact that the world is struggling with the covid-19 and to address the problems of this pandemic must be the foremost priority of the administration. Rather than, coming up with a legal issue in these hard times.</li><li>The International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines warned that (ICHRP) there will be an escalation of rights abuses with the coming of the new law. The right to security and privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to due process will all be curtailed. All these rights are guaranteed to Filipinos by their constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other internationally agreed covenants that are signed by the Philippine.&nbsp;</li><li>Citizens fear that the new Act can be used against any critics, as it will restrain legitimate dissent, giving greater opportunities to authorities to curtail the rights of people without even holding them accountable.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Threat to Mindanao Minorities</strong></h4>



<p>An autonomous region in the south of the Philippines known as “Bangsamoro” is in transition after years of fighting between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Marawi siege delayed the passage of Bangsamoro basic law and hindered the harmonization across communities in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to several reports, due to a prolonged history of bias, the Muslim and Moro minorities are most vulnerable not only to terrorist attacks but to warrantless arrests under the guise of “counterterrorism”. Where Muslims are profiled as violent terrorists even today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, the women of Moro and Muslim minorities face heightened discrimination, especially the ones covering their heads. Instead of seeing widowed women and orphaned children (by conflict), as someone who can inform police for change, counter-terrorism makes police see them as vulnerable to being recruited in terrorism.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s believed that this Act will make it easier to target Muslims and undermine efforts of pacification.</p>



<h4><strong>Protests Against the Bill</strong></h4>



<p>Ever since the bill was proposed, there has been tension throughout the country. People from different human rights groups, educational institutes, and church organizations have come out on the streets and are protesting against this bill amidst the pandemic. Rallies have been carried out in the capital city Manila and other major cities as well. In spite of mass gatherings being prohibited, protest leaders reportedly said that they were compelled to come out on streets to save the country from crossing a dangerous line that violated their freedom of expression. Also, protests were carried out by thousands at the University of Philippines’ main campus at Manila. Here the protesters tried to maintain distance and all wore face masks as a safeguard, while holding placards and chanting slogans questioning the timing of the legislation.<img loading="lazy" width="566" height="362" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gh3zsG9qDI9pp30dYEviM-5iYUZ4e5sERJgeAMvdIkWJUOQvsBEFmQXhOYMav67-XDjoWkfZhSiJW_g2X1gBU6l9yQwdTVc64sQXnciZprXR2lHFVsX75yRg9-41RHulIojyIg"> In another university, situated in Cebu city, the Anti-terror bill rally was also carried out and it is reported that around 30 protestors were trapped inside the university for hours, few among which were arrested during the dispersal, even when the Act provides the right of peaceful protest to people. Some protestors stated the new Act as oppressive and such, which they believe will suppress their right to protest and speak against the wrongdoings of the society while subjugating their ministry of compassion, justice, and peace. Further, they opined that the government should have focussed on problems like poverty, food shortage, medical services, and unemployment instead.</p>



<h4><strong>Legal Challenges</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;The controversial Anti-Terrorism legislation is giving opportunities to opponents to raise immediate legal challenges before the Courts regarding the constitutionality of some of its provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report, an opposition Senator, among the two who voted against the bill is likely to make efforts to challenge it directly to the country’s highest court. Also, a former Supreme Court judge had earlier affirmed that as soon as this bill turns into law it can be questioned directly before the High Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reportedly, the lawyers were waiting for the President’s signature in order to file their legal challenge. Consequently, four petitions were quickly filed after the act was enacted before the Supreme Court, describing its provisions to be vague and violating Human Rights and constitutional principles.</p>



<p>These petitioners filed for the writ of certiorari and prohibition upholding a prayer for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) chairperson and its members. Two of the petitioners pleaded that the Supreme Court after following the procedure should annul the new act for being unconstitutional. While other petitioners only asked for nullification of some sections of the law.</p>



<h4><strong>Response of Government to the Challenges</strong></h4>



<p>According to the reports, in response to all the challenges President Duterte addressed the nationals to not be afraid of the new law. Further, saying that this bill is not a problem for law-abiding citizens and only those people should fear who are planning to bomb churches and public utilities to frustrate the nation.</p>



<p>More than 40,000 people’s lives have been put to an end due to the conflict between the government and the armed wing of the communist party.</p>



<p>In addition to this, the government is of the opinion that people are misunderstanding the powers of the Anti-Terror Council as the council can designate individuals as terrorists only if they are:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Already designated as terrorists by United Nation Security Council in its list and</li><li>If there is evidence that a person may be a terrorist as defined by this law.</li></ol>



<p>The effect of designation does not lead to detention but the council can only forward such designation to the Anti-money laundering council, which will look into the assets. So, it is actually the courts of law through a whole judicial process that can see with certainty and beyond any reasonable doubt that a person or a group of persons are terrorists.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>The new anti-terrorism act has enhanced the power and discretion on its use. Now, the question remains will it be used with a high degree of rationality and attributability or not.</p>



<p>The country’s security agencies are facing trust issues while emphasizing the need to support reformists in these organizations to ramp up professionalization and capacity development and further training. Besides, the supporters of the act are working on the presumption that the security, executive, and judicial institutions would give regard to human rights and would exercise a vigorous degree of accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the contrary, the response of the citizens against the act could be inferred as an exhibition of reduced trust in government institutions given the task of anti-terrorism efforts. They want the government to revoke the act, reopen deliberations and listen to people across society, especially the ones who have been victims of both terrorist violence and abusive counter-terror laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, while any form of terrorism is intolerable, public security can never be at the expense of fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Gulf countries or the “Arabian Gulf” is a group of Arab states that border the Persian Gulf or, in simple terms it is often understood as the group of ‘oil-producing states’ surrounding the Persian Gulf which is a shallow marginal sea in the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Peninsula and southeastern Iran. It is a set of seven countries namely:</p>



<ol><li>Bahrain</li><li>Iraq</li><li>Kuwait</li><li>Oman</li><li>Qatar</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>United Arab Emirates<br>All these countries, except Iraq, are members of the Gulf Cooperation Committee (GCC), a regional intergovernmental organization to foster economic, scientific, and business cooperation among the member countries, and have a lot of things in common, for example, their food styles, values, cultures, etc. However, the main difference lies in their political structures. These countries form some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, mostly due to a boom in oil, natural gas, and petroleum revenues. They also dominate other OPEC ( The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries in oil production and are among the wealthiest countries of the world, on a per capita basis.</li></ol>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="384" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Q9gBDFcL5KOdhTYwf0rHdNDPaYpE5XK9MSCLeQxUKoM5-KawRCw8GQaXZx67lPgD6LdNOylIpoLpjVaizFHr5pcibQX0fs5Aunir8pe36PnXTZ0MbZ4pkB4EQmx62l4U5Ygs-A"></p>



<p><em>According to current estimates, 79.4% of the world&#8217;s proven oil reserves are located in OPEC Member Countries, with the bulk of OPEC oil reserves in the Middle East, amounting to 64.5% of the OPEC total.</em></p>



<h4><strong>A Brief History</strong></h4>



<p>“Discovery of oil” in the Gulf is what has shaped all the affairs of the region, be it history, economy, or polity. In the Gulf region, oil was first found in 1927 in northern Iraq, followed by Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and others over the years.<br>However, considering the importance and the value of the resource that was found there, the greed (amongst the Gulf countries) to take control over all oil reserves and to rule the world, lead to a number of wars, which ultimately resulted in the western intervention in their affairs and left some serious long-term implications on their internal structures, leading to the instability that is witnessed today.<br>• <strong>The Iran-Iraq War</strong></p>



<p>The roots of the Iran- Iraq War (1980-88) lay in a number of territorial and political disputes between Iraq and Iran. However, mainly Iraq wanted to seize control of the rich oil-producing Iranian border region of Khūzestān, a territory inhabited largely by ethnic Arabs. In September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded through a broad front into Khūzestān and captured the city of Khorramshahr but failed to take the important oil-refining center of Ābādān. Iran’s counterattacks began to compel the Iraqis to give ground in 1981. Later in the year 1982, Iraq voluntarily withdrew its forces from all captured Iranian territory and began seeking a peace agreement with Iran. However, the violence continued while both the nations still engaged in sporadic air and missile attacks against each other’s cities and military and oil installations. They also attacked each other’s oil-tanker shipping in the Persian Gulf. The Iran-Iraq war finally ended in 1988 only after the United Nations-brokered a ceasefire.<br>• <strong>The Gulf War</strong></p>



<p>In August 1990, Iraq invaded the country of Kuwait to its southeast in a bid to gain more control over the lucrative oil supply of the Middle East. Alarmed by these actions, fellow Arab powers such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt called on the United States and other Western nations to intervene. The then Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein defied United Nations Security Council&#8217;s demands to withdraw from Kuwait by mid-January 1991, and the Persian Gulf War began with a massive U.S.-led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm. After 42 days of relentless attacks by the allied coalition in the air and on the ground, the then U.S. President George H.W. Bush declared a cease-fire on February 28, 1991; by that time, most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled. Although, as a result of this war Kuwait was liberated, before leaving Iraqi soldiers set fire to about 500 oil wells and dumped millions of gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf, leading to an environmental crisis.</p>

<p>The end of the Gulf war did not, however, mark the end of the involvement of the United States in the Middle East, rather, towards the end of the twentieth century, the foreign policy of the United States and other western nations became more and more netted in the politics of the Gulf.</p>



<h4><strong>The Western Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>The Western intervention in the Middle East started after the end of World War I (WWI) and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. When the allies won WWI, the Middle East was divided between Britain and France according to their own interests rather than those of the ethnic groups of the region. After World War II (WWII), they did not continue in the Gulf and left, but the borders they had created remained. However, after WWII, the US started its involvement when it started to see its interests in the region. Using terrorism as a tactic and growth of OPEC and the use of oil in political ways, it began intervening in the affairs of the Gulf. The presence of oil in the region also found Britain, France, the European Union (EU), and other Western allies carving their ways into the Gulf. As already mentioned, the Gulf War gave the most sought after opportunity to the Western forces to lay their foot on the Arabian soil and shape its internal structures in every manner to support their interests.</p>



<p><strong>Iraq:</strong> On September 11, 2001, an Islamic terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, attacked the World Trade Centre in New York resulting in the killing of thousands of civilians. The US accused Iraq of supplying weapons of mass destruction to Al-Qaeda and on the pretext of seizing those weapons, the US and the allied forces attacked and occupied the Iraqi land in 2003, at the cost of savage bloodshed and mass destruction. The country came under full western control, there were armed forces bases set up, air force patrolling, etc. The US kept building up its strength in Iraq over the years to tens of thousands of soldiers until the end of 2011 when it finally started to withdraw because it did not find any strong evidence to support its claim. The role played by America and Britain post-2003 resulted in a feeling of anger and distress among Iraqis and led fundamentalist organizations to flourish, especially the Islamic State of Iraq. As a result, the US redeployed its forces in Iraq and tried to legitimize its presence in the region on various pretexts, such as protecting US officials and facilities in Iraq, helping the natives to defend themselves, and preventing a possible genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.</p>



<p>Besides Iraq, Western presence has been profound in Yemen, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and UAE as well. “Arab Spring”, which was a series of anti-governmental uprisings in the Arab world in response to the oppressive regimes and low standards of living, paved a way for the Western forces, especially the US, to further its influence in the Gulf countries like Yemen and Bahrain, apart from other Middle-East countries. The slogans which dominated the uprising were <strong>“liberty”, “dignity”, “jobs” </strong>and an<strong> “end to corruption”</strong>. The West apparently identified with these slogans and felt it was on the same side with protesters. But, it had its own interests as well &#8211; the European Union (EU) wanted to stop the Arab migration, which is viewed as a potential source of social tension, into the EU. The US had its strategic interests in the region as it is a vital global energy resource. Besides, the area was of strategic military importance for the US, France, and Britain. The US has installed some of its major army camps in Kuwait (Arifjanin and Buehring camps) and Qatar(Aaliyah camp). Besides, the US air force also maintains installations in Kuwait, UAE, and Qatar along with navy deployments in the region. Apart from this, thousands of troops have been deployed in various states across the Gulf region. It maintains stationing of several dozen personnel in Oman as well.<br>Further, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> has maintained a close relationship with the United States since its inception, given that it was the chief country that called for Western interference in the first place(during the Gulf War). The Saudi-US relations stem from the economics of oil because Saudi holds about a quarter of the world’s known oil reserves. However, some say that it is US hypocrisy because Saudi is a monarchy and its very setup is the antithesis to democracy but the US is still maintaining its ties. The US has been staying back in Saudi, saying it is concerned about the latter’s security, even though there is no formal defense agreement between the two countries. Since the 1990&#8217;s the US has been deploying tens of thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia for its defense against Iraq, and also providing ammunition as well as military training to its army. It also claims to have undertaken several counter-terrorism operations in the region along with the Saudi regime. Even though in recent times the relations of the two have not been really good, but, the military alliance between the two continues. In March 2015, President Barack Obama even declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a &#8220;Joint Planning Cell&#8221; with Saudi Arabia.</p>



<h4><strong>Consequences of Intervention</strong></h4>



<p>Ensuring the free flow of oil represents perhaps the most constant US interest in the Middle East. Europe, China, and Japan all also depend on oil imports for their energy needs. Therefore, since at least the 1970s, America’s key strategic interests in the region have involved not only securing easy access for itself but also guaranteeing an open and secure market for Japan and Europe. No doubt, the presence of Western agencies has had some positive influences on the otherwise non-democratic and non-liberal Gulf regimes and it has to a very great extent helped in the development of these countries as well. However, the fact remains, that intervention in any country&#8217;s internal affairs beyond a particular level becomes undesirable and produces contravening and destabilizing effects on that country. Similarly, years of Western intervention in the Gulf has left its ill impacts on the region on various fronts. </p>



<p><strong>Given under are some of the unfortunate effects of Western Intervention in various Gulf regions:</strong><br>• The continuous presence and intervention of the US in Iraq have had grave results on all fronts, be it humanitarian, political, economic, or cultural. Ever since 2003, millions of people have been displaced, thousands killed, nearly one-third of the population living in poverty, making it one of the biggest catastrophes of the world. The US with its entry also gave a blow to the state-owned factories and enterprises by introducing foreign investments and gradually resulted in an unprecedented increase in unemployment of the natives. Further, it also destroyed the cultural heritage of Iraq with its art museums and other important cultural institutions being damaged during the early occupation. Also, the Western presence was supposed to bring about a democratic reform but, even today, democracy remains a dream. Instead, it has increased terrorism and sectarian violence and also increased competition and rivalries amongst various regional actors. Thus, as far as Iraq is concerned, an intervention (from the West) which was justified on humanitarian grounds, resulted in a grossly negative impact and distorted its entire structure, while not even serving altogether fruitful for the US as well, as it also suffered huge loss over the years while engaging in various warfares in Iraq.</p>



<p>• Even though there has been no direct uprising against the presence of the US in Arab, but, there has been growing resentment among the masses against it. In such circumstances, supporting the Western presence by some Arab nations has resulted in an ever-developing feeling of humiliation and a strong sense of loss in the populace. Western presence has also been used by terrorist organizations to radicalize young men. This sentiment if not addressed seriously can result in further unrest in the region and may even result in a popular revolt, destroying the social, political, and economical structure very badly.<br>• As a <strong>result of the intervention</strong>, just like in Iraq, inherent tribal, sectarian, and ethnic conflicts in other countries also have intensified. Further, it has resulted in pressure upon the Arab world from two opposite directions, one, the originally Islamic Fundamentalist ideology, and two, the ‘’ democracy’’ and ‘’freedom’’ ideas promoted by Western powers.</p>



<p>• <strong>According to the United Nations</strong>, as a result of the Saudi led airstrikes in Yemen (which is in a state of war over the transition of power), 7,700 civilian deaths have taken place till March 2020, and currently Yemen is experiencing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. In doing so, the coalition has received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK, and France.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="636" height="369" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UcFIRaa05DeyNvIJvYEa0QTfgDF9prmvOBWKnRZr_K9jmiCVdh7UkTIUWekeng22b2cWQXLanH-J8YYq4XYjV1ReqRJAcPKHgSZJCJvoEi2Xu3uB7GdQOhVkZxLU4Io-84nkeg"></p>



<p><em>More than 60% of civilian deaths have been the result of Saudi-led airstrikes, the UN says [EPA]</em></p>



<p>• In <strong>Bahrain</strong>, where there was an uprising, mainly sectarian, to overthrow the existing regime in 2014, the US, along with Saudi again, cracked down upon the people seeking their rights. It adopted a policy of blanketing Manama, the capital of Bahrain, and surrounding villages with tanks and armored personnel carriers, using live ammunition as well as tear gas and rubber bullets to break up demonstrations. Even though the uprising was in its favor as it encouraged the ‘democratic sentiment’ but, it suppressed it forcefully in order to secure its larger interest, that is, its relations with Saudi Arabia. Therefore, it can be said that on one hand, the west pretends to maintain the presence of authoritarian regimes as far as it serves its interest. On the other, it prefers to pretend as if it upholds the principle of democracy by popular voices and choices in the Arab world.<br>International intervention is a common phenomenon in international relations. In the modern era of globalization and technological development, intervention by various international actors such as the United Nations and other international organizations are somewhat indispensable in order to bring about coordination in the international community and also to ensure equality and justice at the global level. However, intervention is of two types, “power intervention” and “well-intentioned intervention”. Power intervention means “interference” in the affairs of another country, whereas, well-intentioned intervention is intervening with a positive approach. The intervention thus, must with an intention to help the region to progress and to diffuse the long-existing crisis and must be up to a certain level. But, the Western intervention in the Gulf has been ‘power intervention’. At the international level, the sovereignty of a nation is the most sacred principle, respecting the authority and supremacy of a nation with respect to its internal affairs is the obligation of every other nation. Intervening to a point where it infringes the sovereignty of that country is condemnable and produces most often, devastating results, as can be witnessed in the Gulf today. A region that was supposed to be so well developed and rich is reeling under an unprecedented conflict and humanitarian crisis, as a result of years of uncontrolled Western intervention. Therefore, the international community must unite and call upon the West to withdraw from the Gulf and help it rejuvenate its culture, economy, polity, and ultimately bring about stability.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with an area of 2.3m sq/km, is a giant of sub-Saharan Africa, bordered by nine other countries. DRC was formerly referred to as Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-Leopoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire. It is the 2nd largest country in the African Continent after Algeria and the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa with Kinshasa it&#8217;s Capital. It has been divided into 26 provinces.<br>The country has enormous mineral wealth – copper, diamond, gold, cobalt, etc., and potentially large reserves of oil and natural gas. Paradoxically, this resource-rich country is also the site of one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The conflicts of 1996 and 1998 have resulted in massive disruption of the social, political, and economic fabric of the country. For over a decade the country has been mired in conflict with devastating effects on its civilian population. Though the parties involved within the conflict have their perspective regarding the cause and course of the conflict, nobody can deny that the region is in dire need of peace as well as sustainable development to break the ‘conflict trap’ that has brought miseries for all the conflict-ridden countries of the world including the ones in the African continent.<br>The costs of the conflict are self-evident. Besides death and destruction, large-scale displacement is an integral part of the conflict. Other humanitarian costs include a negative impact on women and other vulnerable groups, and there has been a noticeable increase in post-trauma stress syndrome and the resultant psychiatric problems for the victims. The economic costs of the conflict cannot be confined to a particular sector of industry or investment prospects. It has affected the important sources of livelihood of the local people.</p>



<h4><strong>Colonization and Independence</strong></h4>



<p>The colonization in DRC started in 1870 by King Leopold II of Belgium with the exploitation of natural resources, forced labor, mass killings, and widespread slave labor through his harsh rule for almost 90 years. The country witnessed brutal colonization following a hue and cry internationally. In 1908, the Belgian parliament took over the Free State from Leopold following international pressure, and then it became the Belgian Congo, under the rule of the elected Belgian government.<br>Patrice Lumumba was elected the First Prime Minister of the DRC in May 1960. But after a few months, the PM was overthrown by a military group led by Joseph Desire Mobutu with the help from the US and Belgium and was later assassinated in 1961<br>Joseph Mobutu after overthrowing the PM Lumumba started a dictatorship for almost 36 years, and during this period he renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko and renamed the country Zaire and the country was known as Zaire from 1971 to 1997.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin of Crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo</strong></h4>



<p><strong>• The Mobutu Era and First Congo Conflict</strong></p>



<p>During the tenure of Joseph Mobutu, a one-party system was established wherein elections were held periodically, with the incumbent head of the state as the only candidate. Mobutu was guilty of severe human rights violations and political repression. Corruption was integral to the system, and politicians became entirely dependent on Mobutu’s goodwill. He consolidated power by co-opting potential rivals and exploited the country’s vast natural resources. By the 1990s, the country’s economy was near collapse due to mismanagement, corruption, and authoritarianism. This overall dismal scenario and the later happenings in the DRC gave credibility to the stance that conflicts in Africa, including the one in the DRC, are due to ‘bad governance’.</p>



<p>Bad governance within the state accompanied by the external dimension, i.e. the Rwandan genocide of 1994 laid the foundation of conflict in the DRC. Some of the militias responsible for killing thousands of Tutsis in Rwanda fled across the border to the DRC. This provoked Rwanda and Uganda to invade the Congo and finally, they invaded the DRC in July 1996.<br>The Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo (AFDL) under the leadership of Laurent Kabila and backed by Rwanda and Uganda ousted Mobutu in May 1997. The ascendancy of Kabila led to the end of the first conflict, and the name of the country was restored to the DRC.</p>



<p>• <strong>Kabila Regime and the Second Congo Conflict</strong></p>



<p>Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of the exploitation of resources and with the help of many countries, overthrew Rwanda and Uganda out of DRC. The Lusaka ceasefire agreement (July 1999) and deployment of the UN peacekeeping force in 2000 attempted to end the hostilities between nations. However, the violence continued in DRC from 1998 to 2003. Rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda fought Government forces supported by Angola Namibia attacked back resulting in the second Congo war. In addition to this, there was also a proxy war which continued till 2008 between Rwanda and Uganda.</p>



<h4><strong>Peace and Democratic Attempts</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>Consequences of the Crisis</strong>:</h4>



<p><strong>• Killings and Displacement</strong></p>



<p>The people of the DRC have suffered immensely throughout colonial times and in the post-independence era. The continuation of an exploitative colonial legacy by the leaders of the independent DRC brought a trail of death, destruction, and underdevelopment for the people. The ongoing conflicts have aggravated the situation. It has claimed numerous lives and plunged the resource-rich country into chaos and acute underdevelopment.</p>

<p><em>12 year old amputee Kakule Elie, hit by a stray bullet, lies in a bed in a hospital in Goma in 2012</em></p>



<p>The United Nations in 2005 described the crisis in Eastern Congo, as the ‘world’s worst humanitarian crisis.’ Since 2000, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has documented the humanitarian impact of conflict through mortality surveys. The first four studies, conducted by IRC, estimated that 3.9 million people had died since 1998. About 10 percent of all the deaths were due to violence and 90 percent were due to diseases like malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition. The fifth survey concluded that 5.4 million deaths have occurred between 1998 and 2007, with as many as 45,000 people dying every month. As with previous IRC studies in the DRC, the majority of deaths have been due to infectious diseases, malnutrition, and maternity-related problems. In 2007, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs put the figures of internally displaced persons at 1.16 million. The UNHCR put the figures for Congolese refugees in the neighboring countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda at 310,000. A Human Rights Watch report has accused DRC‘s neighboring countries of committing abuses both economically as well as physically.</p>

<p><em>The M23 group is fighting the DRC military for control of the country, and the violence is driving tens of thousands of Congolese out of their homes.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Impact of Crisis on Women and Children</strong></h4>



<p>The most vulnerable to the Congo crisis are women and children. Displacement increases women’s risk of sexual violence. Many children lose access to education. While the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) works to integrate all displaced children within the DRC into a national education system, many of the schools still lack the resources necessary to effectively support the staff and students. UNHRC is on the ground providing life-saving humanitarian support to millions of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees in the DRC.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Word\women.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r1XZZxvUrGfo8-A2wu86wj6Q9QvK_Cz0ZW0YytKvIwyWFnGUgmGj6vvcdjrt22PDMYUiljuIzshehkiKGsVdN2S7BXb-9nv5JFdC-p-ByDaLQkQGjWVC9QJ7hNA6ge-HQvy9Cg" width="488" height="277"></p>



<p><em>A displaced Congolese woman carries her belongings as she enters a United Nations base in Monigi, 5 Km from Goma in 2012.</em></p>



<p>According to Jeanie Bandu Bahati (coordinator of an organization that promoted development, gender, and peace) held that there is a catastrophic and chaotic situation in DRC with women and girls confronted by permanent displacement, massacres, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, house burning, etc.<br>According to a report by the International Rescue Committee, since the end of the 1st war in DRC in 1998, at least 5.4 million people have died. Due to hunger, diseases, violence, and displacement every month 45000 Congolese die (half of them are children).<br>Eastern Congo is the world’s worst place for women. Rape in Congo exists on a scale seen nowhere in the world is used as a weapon of war. Rape as a weapon of war had destroyed women, families, and communities.<br>The United Nations peace-keeping forces have been accused of adding to the woes of the people. According to a 2007 report of the Human Rights Watch from December 2004 to August 2006, around 140 allegations of sexual exploitation involving United Nations personnel were recorded in Congo.</p>



<p>• <strong>Economic Implications</strong></p>



<p>The conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue and increased external debt. Foreign business houses have curtailed operations due to an uncertain atmosphere, lack of infrastructure, and a non-conducive and difficult work environment. There has been an increase in unemployment. A country rich in natural resources has become one of the least developed countries. The infrastructure in terms of road density, electrification, and water supply remains poor. The country is the world’s largest producer of cobalt and a major producer of copper and diamond but the resources of the country have been a curse and brought misfortunes for the natives and all the benefits have gone to the outsiders. Resources have been used to fuel conflict and not to get people out of poverty. In 2007, the Human Development Index ranked the country at 168 positions out of a total of 177 countries.</p>



<p>The unstable situation has provided a fertile ground for the stakeholders to exploit the natural wealth of DRC with impunity. A United Nations report published in April 2001 pointed out that all the parties involved in the conflict profited by looting resources of DRC. The overall situation hence remains fragile and poverty is all-pervasive.<br>The DRC is emerging from a decade of political instability and violent conflict that has led to the near-collapse of the economy and caused the annual per capita income to plummet to $120 in 2005 (down from $380 in 1985). Experts have described this as ‘development in reverse.’ The country has the second-largest swath of rainforests in the world. With 86 million hectares of the area covered by rainforests, the DRC accounts for over half of the total remaining rainforests in the Central Africa region. Congo forests are a vital resource, both for the Congolese people and the global environment. About 40 million Congolese depend on the forests for their food, income, energy, shelter, medicines, and cultural needs. Described as the ‘second lung’ of the planet for their ability to store carbon dioxide on a global scale, these Congolese forests too have been threatened by widespread poverty and instability in the region.</p>



<h4><strong>International Response</strong></h4>



<p>The UN and various International communities have been greatly involved in seeking a resolution to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) conflict, specifically in the past decade.</p>



<p><strong>• Human Rights Council (HRC)</strong></p>



<p>In the HRC Report 2012, the HRC referenced Resolution 19/27, which was adopted in March 2012. The resolution encouraged the establishment of a national Human Rights Commission in the DRC and asked the High Commissioner of Human Rights to submit a report in 2013.</p>



<p><strong>I. United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)</strong></p>



<p>In October 2010, the OHCHR released a report on the DRC entitled “DRC: Mapping Human Rights Violations 1993-2003”. The report notes the serious incidents of Human Rights abuses. OHCHR also addressed the issue of sexual violence in its 2011 report entitled “Remedies and Reparations for Victims of Sexual Violence in DRC”. The report highlighted how victims of sexual violence are often responsible for bearing the cost of harm done to them and asked the Congolese Government to implement a reparations fund for victims of sexual violence.</p>



<p><strong>• International Criminal Court (ICC)</strong></p>



<p>In 2004, the then-president of DRC (Kabila) referred his country to the ICC and the former ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo formally announced his decision to open the first-ever ICC investigation into the crimes committed in the DRC.<br>In 2012, former Leader of the Union Des Patriotes Congolais (UPC), Thomas Lubanga, was convicted of war crimes and child soldiers and was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in jail.</p>



<p>• United Nations Security Council (UNSCThe most crucial element of the UNSC’s intervention in the DRC has been its authorization of two missions to the country. First is the United Nations Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) that was established in 1999 following the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. MONUC was succeeded in 2010 by United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO), aimed to better protect civilians and address issues that were raised during the MONUC period, including the sexual abuse by United Nations Peacekeepers.</p>



<h4><strong>Regional Response</strong></h4>



<p><strong>I. Southern African Development Community (SADC</strong>)</p>



<p>In 2008, the members of SADC (heads of state) agreed to immediately deploy a team of military experts to assess the escalating violence in the country, as well as an additional team to evaluate the situation on the ground.</p>



<p>• <strong>International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the February 2013 Framework Agreement</strong></p>



<p>Congolese President Kabila used the ICGLR as a platform for discussion by convening a series of meetings. The Peace Agreement that was signed in 2013 by Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the DRC, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia was negotiated by UNSC with ICGLR. The Agreement emphasized issues of sexual violence and displacement, among other Human Rights abuses, and noted that progress begins with the cessation of violence.<br>At the country level, the DRC agreed to work towards decentralization and further structural form. Regional players promised to respect not only one another’s sovereignty but to also increase cooperation between states.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The political situation in the DRC is bad. The extreme violence in the country is from the very beginning but the violence in the country exacerbated due to the failure of holding the presidential election constitutionally. The governance problems have an immediate impact on the humanitarian situation. Ultimately, the spirit of democracy not guns must rule the DRC, and improvements in governance should be the primary focus of all the local, regional as well as international actors in their efforts to help the long-suffering people. To avoid the return of the conflict the reconstruction process has to accompany initiatives to control violence. The DRC needs global assistance to make a speedy economic recovery and to ensure that the fruits of the development are distributed equitably. There is an urgent need to address the disparities among different communities that inhabit the country and promote democracy and the rule of law, which can combat corruption and promote good governance. Without an integrated approach that involves national and international institutions, the return to chaos is imminent as shallow peace may not be sustainable. The continued and genuine efforts by local, national, and international actors that work in tandem can be the only way out for the country to experience genuine democracy and prevent a return to chaos.</p>



<p>The Government of DRC to create a conducive climate for dialogue must ensure that human rights and rule of law will be respected and the justice system will be ceased as a political tool. The political prisoners at the first instance should be released and the persons subjected to harsh violence to be rehabilitated.<br>The persons who have been forced to flee to different areas must be provided with humanitarian assistance and ways must be carved out to end this conflict which is in DRC for years now. The humanitarian condition of women in the country can be described as degrading and chaotic. The condition of women folk has worsened in the last two decades. There needs a revision of protection, security, socio-economic and political factors to uplift the condition of women and children in DRC.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis across the globe, with an estimated 24 million people, which makes about 80 percent of the total population in grave need of humanitarian assistance including millions of children.<br>Yemen officially known as The Republic of Yemen is a nation situated at the Southern end of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia, covering the second largest part of the Arabian Peninsula as being a Sovereign State.<br>Since the conflict arose, civilians of Yemen have been the victim of bad governance, holding a range of unredressed grievances that include violence, attacks, arbitrary detentions, torture, and enforced disappearances. Moreover, humanitarian aid has been impeded from time to time, and problems such as violence against women, famine, poverty; diseases have taken a spike. The ongoing conflict has damaged the economy and infrastructure of the country on a larger scale, leading to the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe.</p>



<h4>Historical perspective: Yemeni Civil War</h4>



<p>In ancient times, Yemen was ruled by Sabaeans, which prospered as a trading state for centuries altogether. Later, the Jewish influenced Himyarite Kingdom came into existence. Religions, primarily Christianity and Islam, grew rapidly in the 4th and 7th centuries, respectively. It can be seen that the administration of Yemen has long been in a state of turmoil, from the emergence of different dynasties to the unification of Northern and Southern Yemen, forming the present Republic of Yemen.<br>To begin with, the conflict of Yemen has its roots in the non-fulfillment of political transition supposed to bring firmness following an Arab Spring uprising that forced its long-time president, Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over his power to his deputy Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. But unfortunately, Mr. Hadi could not deal with many problems such as separatist movement in the south, attacks by jihadists, unemployment, corruption, food shortage, etc. Besides, a Houthi movement known as Ansar Allah led by Yemen’s Zaidi- Shia Muslim minority, fought several rebellions against Saleh and took advantage of Hadi’s inability by taking the northern province of Saada and vicinity under control.<br>Disillusioned with the transition, many Yemeni Sunnis supported Houthi, and later the rebellions gradually took over the capital city Sana’a. As a result of which two groups came into existence: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi &#8211; led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement along with their allies and supporters, both claiming to establish the official government of Yemen.</p>



<p>Sana’a which is controlled by Houthi forces along with its allies who were loyal to the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh conflict with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Also, attacks have been carried out by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL). At the same time, the Hadi government had clashes with United Arab Emirates (UAE) forces as a result of their military measures. The Houthi led supreme revolutionary committee after taking over Sana’a along with its government declared a mobilization to topple Hadi and extend their control by conquering southern Yemen.<br>The Saudi-led bombing campaign has been criticized largely by people at large which has resulted in the mass killing of civilians as per the Yemen data project.<br>Furthermore, according to a report, the Saudi led coalition attacked Houthi Saleh forces in support of President Hadi. As the war continued, alliances broke, and Saleh was assassinated in a clash. Consequently, war broke out between UAE backed Yemeni forces in Aden and Yemeni government forces due to which civilians suffered a spiraling economic crisis, lack of essential services, broken governance, health, education, and judicial systems.</p>



<h4><strong>Crisis in Yemen: Major Reasons</strong></h4>



<p>The intensity of the Crisis in Yemen can be understood with this, that even the delivery of much needed humanitarian aid is unlawfully impeded; the ongoing armed conflicts have affected the civilian population terribly, Airstrikes have been conducted by coalitions killing thousands of civilians. Moreover, Houthi forces recruited children, used banned landmines, and damaged major cities killing and injuring commoners. Activists and journalists have been threatened and harassed. Besides, Houthi forces have taken hostages, raped, and tortured detained migrants.<br>On the contrary, the imputability has been woefully inadequate even when there is much evidence of infringement of International law by the parties to the conflict.</p>



<p>●<strong> Unlawful Airstrike</strong><br>Human Rights Watch: An International non-governmental Organization has documented a number of airstrikes apparently conducted by the Saudi-led coalition, including deadly attacks on Yemen&#8217;s fishing boats. Further, it has been documented that, since the war began more than 20,100 airstrikes have been conducted on Yemen by a Saudi-led coalition that amounts to an average of 12 attacks a day. Destroying hospitals, market places, bridges, factories, detention centers, etc.</p>



<p>●<strong> Children and Armed Conflict</strong><br>According to a United Nation report on Yemen, all the parties to the conflict have used child soldiers under the age of 18 and 15 years, mostly recruited by Houthis.<br>The United Nation Secretary-General released an annual “list of shame” for violations against children in armed conflict, which has detailed that the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for the death and injury of 729 children, Houthis were responsible for the death of 398 children, and 58 children were killed and injured by Yemeni government forces. The irony here is that the secretary-general listed the Saudi-led coalition in this list on the one hand and categorized it as a step to improvisation on the other hand, despite the mounting evidence that these forces killed and harmed children on a larger scale.</p>



<p>● <strong>Arbitrary Detentions, Torture, and Enforced Disappearances.</strong><br>All the parties to the conflict in Yemen have arbitrarily detained people, abused them and subjected them to poor conditions, and forcibly abducted and disappeared people perceived to be political opponents or security threats.<br>It is evident from different reports that detention facilities controlled by UAE and UAE backed forces arbitrarily detained and tortured detainees, who are suspected to be members of ISIL and AQAP.<br>In the same way, Houthis have also been made responsible for dozens of cases of arbitrarily detaining and enforcing disappearances, while being subjected to torture and other ill-treatment which include beating with iron rods, rifles, and being hung from walls with their arms shackled behind them.<br>For these reasons, the female members of the families of the abducted men have protested in front of the prisons in major cities of Yemen hoping for their kidnapped sons, fathers, brothers to be searched, these have been grouped under a name which is “Mothers of Abductees Association”. This association reported the Disappearance of 3,478 cases, among which 128 were killed.<br>Not only this but, academicians, students, Politicians, Journalists, and other minority groups have reported being harassed by Houthis.</p>



<p>●<strong> Landmines</strong><br>Reportedly, Houthis have installed landmines throughout Yemen, such as anti-personnel mines, improvised explosive devices, and anti-vehicle mines along the western coast of Yemen, causing hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries. In addition to which, aid workers’ abilities to reach vulnerable people got obstructed. Their use has been documented in six governorates. Since the conflict arose, at least 140 civilians, including 19 children&#8217;s lives have been put to an end because of these landmines. While landmines have been planted in farmlands, roads, villages, and wells civilians access have been prevented especially farmers whose life completely depends upon crops and water. Demining efforts also face many problems.</p>



<p>● <strong>Famine</strong><br>Millions of people are starving in Yemen; half of them are suffering extreme levels of hunger or are a step away from famine. The percentage of famine cases is increasing year by year. Two-third of all districts in Yemen are already pre-famine. Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) reported that more than 85,000 civilians have died as a result of ongoing famine.<br>On the other hand, food shortage is gravely affecting IDPs and host communities, marginalized groups, landless wage laborers, and the fishing communities. In addition to this, it has been warned that more than 13 million Yemenis face starvation and that it could become “the worst famine in the world in 100 years”.</p>



<h4><strong>Need for Humanitarian Aid:</strong></h4>



<p>In order to survive, a large number of people seek humanitarian assistance. The situation is getting exacerbated year by year with the millions of Yemenis facing hunger, health issues, and other problems. Among the countries, 29 million inhabitants’, 24 million people need some sort of protection. While some have fewer needs, others have severe needs. Out of every 10 Yemeni civilians, more than 8 are in need of humanitarian aid, being the only option left with them.</p>



<h4><strong>Agreements by the Parties to the conflict:</strong></h4>



<p>The Peace talks in United Nations between the Houthis and the Yemeni government in December 2018, (when the special envoy of United Nations Secretary-General for Yemen brokered a cease-fire, known as the Stockholm Agreement) led to the termination of hostilities in the coastal towns of Hodeida, Salif, and Ras’ Issa. But, their agreement did not include other ground fightings and the new military funds.<br>The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi urged International scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s International Law infringements in Yemen and other states’ potential complicity in abuses through arms sales. Few European countries such as Norway, Finland, Netherlands, and Germany either reviewed or suspended their arms sales to members of the Saudi-led coalition, on the other hand, countries including the US, Canada, France, and Australia are still supplying military weapons.</p>



<h4>Governmental Initiatives:</h4>



<p>In terms of area, most part of Yemen is controlled by the official Yemen government. But, when it comes to population, major cities such as Sana&#8217;a and Sa&#8217;dah are controlled by Houthi forces. Thus, even if the government takes certain steps or initiatives, implementation becomes difficult.<br>As such, the vision of Yemen&#8217;s government is to elevate Yemen&#8217;s international ranking to that of a medium ‘human development’ country. While, trying to stop the growing threat of famine and negotiate with different nations to effectively try to unblock imports, ensure distribution of aid, and counteract a lack of foreign exchange in this nation. But, still, Yemen’s weak governance capacity and poor fiduciary environment have hampered its access to reach out to people in need. Reportedly, Yemen’s government is helpless, as the Houthis have seized most of its weapons during the coup. So, Due to the lack of resources, it is not able to cope up with the consequences of conflict.</p>



<h4><strong>What Can Be Done:</strong></h4>



<p>The conflict has had a polarizing impact on society at the local level. Thus, initiatives must be taken to help alleviate the crisis and they are as follows;</p>



<p>⮚ <strong>First</strong>, emphasis should be made on the importance of practical solutions. While easing the pressure on people with the help of humanitarian efforts and focusing on depoliticizing the supply of food and health care<br>⮚ <strong>Second</strong>, negotiations regarding the conflict and safe humanitarian access, and aid pipelines must be worked out by all the parties to the conflict. So, nations across the world should contest any efforts that allow Houthis to remain armed.<br>⮚<strong> Third</strong>, parties to the conflict must respect the international humanitarian law and have an obligation to take certain precautions to limit the impact of conflict on civilians.<br>⮚<strong> Fourth</strong>, the government must ensure that public sector workers are paid salaries so that the continuation of essential services is not hindered.<br>⮚<strong> Fifth</strong>, diplomatic channels should remain open and humanitarian financing and action needs to be impartial and neutral.<br>⮚ <strong>Sixth</strong>, a bit can be done by individuals across the globe by donating through the number of organizations and foundations working for this cause.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>It cannot be denied that for years, the United Nations and its partners have been trying to protect the people of Yemen. For example, each month, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) distributes 1 lac metric tons of food, which reaches more than 8 million Yemenis; The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has provided cholera vaccines to more than 3 lac people; United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)has provided reproductive health services to 2,50,000 women, and the United Nation Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) works with the government at all levels to increase coordination and betterment.<br>Despite this, the conflict of Yemen is multifaceted and characterized by deep mistrust. Virtually, everyone in Yemen has been the victim of this destructive armed conflict and the past five years have left the people completely exhausted.<br><br></p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>People whose gender identity lies beyond or between the categories of women and men – or who live and love outside the norms of heterosexuality – have been agents of change and builders of community throughout history and around the world. Across cultures and social strata, sexual and gender minorities are family members, workers, policy-makers, peacebuilders, soldiers, refugees, and ordinary people. The struggle for recognition and rights for the LGBTQ+ community has strengthened with wider movements for social justice, and the safe spaces they have forged amidst adversity have served as sites of tolerance and solidarity in often difficult times. Nonetheless, sexual and gender minority populations and communities continue to face violence and discrimination, in both conflict and peace, owing to the social norms and attitudes that denigrate their humanity and render them vulnerable.</p>



<h4><strong>System of Violence and Discrimination</strong></h4>



<p>In many societies, discrimination means that states fail to provide for the security needs of sexual and gender minority persons, leaving them in a position of vulnerability. In terms of survival mechanisms, many sexual and gender minority individuals are forced to hide their gender identity vis-à-vis other members of society and, where possible, rely on clandestine networks of trust and mutual support. Several countries still criminalize same-sex relations, but it is everyday discrimination and violence that might be the most urgent problem for LGBTQ persons. Sexual and gender minority individuals experience forced institutionalization in mental rehabilitation clinics, electroshock treatment as aversion therapy, sexual harassment in school and at work, threats of rape to make you straight, school expulsions, eviction by landlords, police kidnapping, family violence, and media stigmatization. Sexual and gender minorities face discrimination in the workplace because of their gender and their sexual orientation. Employment and job promotions are denied if women look too masculine. Male co-workers stalk and sexually harass lesbians who cannot report for fear of backlash and retaliation. Transgender variant people are marginalized in their jobs and are targeted for blackmail, harassment, and sexual violence from the community or people in positions of authority like the police. Activists who defend the rights of LGBTQ people experience threats to their safety, in some cases, harassment, attacks, even torture, and abuse, with police participating in or doing nothing to stop these violations.<strong>[i]</strong></p>



<p>Discrimination and harassment in workplaces, being denied stable employment or housing, not obtaining identity cards that indicate their chosen gender are some more issues facing the LGBTQ community. The cultural pressures and importance of family life are however the greatest obstacle. “The family unit is arguably the greatest influence on the lives of LGBTQ people, yet acceptance by families is limited by strong cultural pressures.”<strong>[ii]</strong></p>



<p>International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) reports that those who challenge sexual or gender norms often confront violence in the “private” sphere of the family. The threat of family or community rejection or recrimination often prompts people to lead double lives, making them vulnerable to police blackmail and extortion. Queer and transgender persons and other gender non-conforming people and communities face hostility, discrimination, and abuse in most places.</p>



<h4><strong>Forms of Violence and Discrimination</strong></h4>



<p>Some of the forms of violence and discrimination that sexual and gender minority individuals and communities face in conflict and peacetime can be categorized as follows:</p>



<ol><li>&nbsp;Targeted violence, including killing and sexual violence;</li><li>&nbsp;Policing of gender norms;</li><li>Blackmail and extortion; and&nbsp;</li><li>Rejection by family and other community members.</li></ol>



<p>We use this division for the sake of classification, but the differentiation between these forms of violence is somewhat forced, as in practice many of these forms occur simultaneously and/or one form might lead to another.</p>



<h4><strong>Targeted Violence against Sexual and Gender Minority Persons</strong></h4>



<p>Armed groups of very different ideological persuasions have used targeted violence like murder, against sexual and gender minority persons. The most systematic targeting was arguably that by Nazi Germany, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and trans persons from 1933 to 1945.<strong>[iii]</strong> </p>



<p>Syria and Iraq are currently among the prime groups in which targeted violence against sexual and gender minority people is most pronounced and visible. The violence committed by Islamic State, which includes the sentencing and the alleged execution of gay men by throwing them off buildings as well as targeted violence against lesbian women, has gained the most international prominence. However, other militias as well as state security forces have also targeted sexual and gender minority individuals, including specifically lesbian women in Iraq and Syria for persecution, violence, and murder.<strong>[iv]</strong></p>



<p>Nonetheless, it is not only those self-identifying as a sexual and gender minority person who is targeted. Iraqi men accused of being ‘effeminate’ and women accused of being too masculine (and therefore suspected of being gay or lesbian), based on their mannerisms, sartorial style, haircut or the like, faced violence including death, from family and community members, state security forces and militias such as the League of the Righteous (Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq) and the Mahdi Army (Jaish al-Mahdi).<strong>[v]</strong></p>



<p>Asa&#8217;ib Ahl al-Haq is an Iraqi Shi&#8217;a political party and paramilitary group active in the Iraqi insurgency and Syrian Civil War and the Mahdi Army, also known as the Jaysh al-Mahdi, is a Shiite militia which rose to international prominence in 2004 when it spearheaded the first major armed confrontation against the US forces in Iraq from the Shia community.</p>



<p>It is difficult to evaluate the degree of oppression that LGBTQ persons face in various countries in the region as there is a lack of reliable data. In Cambodia, homophobic attacks and abuse are reported in public places such as markets and clubs and in community settings.</p>



<h4><strong>Legal, Social and Ideological Frameworks of Exclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The vulnerability of sexual and gender minority communities and individuals to violence and discrimination is underpinned by legal, social, and ideological narratives and forms of exclusion, which may reduce or deny them access to the services or rights provided to other citizens. In fragile and conflict-affected states where services are often limited from the start, sexual and gender minority persons are left in one of the most vulnerable positions in society. In countries where same-sex activities are illegal, reporting sexual and gender-based violence to the police can put the victim/survivor in the position of the criminal. As of 2019, some 77 countries have laws that criminalize same-sex sexual practices, some going as far as to criminalize identities, in particular trans identities, as well as acts.<strong>[vi] </strong></p>



<p>These laws expose people who are already socially marginalized within heteronormative societies to arrest and prosecution for consensual sexual activities and their gender expressions. Criminal laws against homosexuality or other forms of non-normative sexuality also protect the perpetrators of homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic violence by restricting the ability of their victims to file complaints or press charges. Even where such laws are not enforced, as in Nigeria where a moratorium currently stands on the use of the death penalty for those convicted of homosexual acts, the existence of those laws nonetheless constitutes a form of “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” and legitimizes persecution.<strong>[vii]</strong> </p>



<p>Wherever they exist, such laws can be and at times are held over the heads of sexual and gender minority people, used not only to prosecute them but also to marginalize, blackmail, and extort them.</p>



<h4><strong>Extra-legal Harassment and Violence</strong></h4>



<p>In addition to legal criminalization and excessive use of punishment and detention, sexual and gender minority communities frequently face extra-legal harassment and violence from state security actors including police and militaries. Even in the regions of Russia, gay men claimed that they were abducted and tortured by authorities in Chechnya amid what rights groups call a brutal “purge” targeting sexual minorities in the Russian region.<strong>[viii] </strong></p>



<p>In several Eastern European countries, bombs have destroyed gay bars and right-wing parties have attacked homosexuals. A bomb exploded outside a gay club in the capital of Latvia in February 1995, for instance, and the main suspect was a member of an extremist party that called for action against homosexuals. At least 20 people were injured when the Czech Republic&#8217;s first-ever Gay Pride parade was attacked by right-wing extremists armed with tear gas in 2008.<strong>[ix] </strong></p>



<p>In Orlando, Florida a gunman attacks a gay nightclub in 2016 leaving 50 dead.<strong>[x]</strong> </p>



<p>A lack of police protection only encourages such violence. Government disregard for anti-LGBT violence is particularly blatant in Latin America. Often, the murders of gay men are labeled as “sex crimes” by the authorities, as with the 1998 murder of a prominent activist in Romania and of killings of five well-known Mexican gay men in July 1992. Equally as common is an inadequate investigation. In addition, more than 445 LGBT Brazilians died as victims of homophobia in 2017<strong>[xi]</strong></p>



<p>Homosexuals are a prime target for continuous attacks, killings, theft, blackmail, and extortion because they are still more afraid of the police than they are of the bandits. The Blue Diamond Society (BDS), which provides advocacy and assistance to sexual and gender minority people in Nepal, has noted that increases in violence against people who fall outside normative gender and sexual identities are “directly linked to the increased mobilization of military and police given the critical security situation in the country.”<strong>[xii]</strong> </p>



<p>In spite of anti-harassment regulations in the Nepali armed forces, there have been individual cases of discrimination reported against allegedly lesbian soldiers.<strong>[xiii]</strong></p>



<p>Similarly, in South Africa, some lesbian cadres in the armed wing of the African National Congress, the <em>uMkhonto we Sizwe</em>, the armed wing of the African National Congress, co-founded by Nelson Mandela in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre,[xiv] was subjected to sexual harassment, abuse, and violence by their male comrades, even was official there was a commitment to diversity.<strong>[xv]</strong></p>



<p>Globally, the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (UN OHCHR) has noted widespread assault and torture perpetrated by security forces against people identified as gay or transgender, including violence that particularly targets the features marking them as different. In a 2012 report, the UN OHCHR documented cases where trans women had been beaten on their breasts and cheekbones, where they had surgical implants, to release toxins. In Uganda and Lebanon, police and army officers have routinely extorted sexual and gender minority refugees who engage in sex work for sexual services, with threats of harm, deportation, or public outing. <strong>[xvi]</strong></p>



<h4><strong>What Policies Can Improve LGBT+ Inclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The United Nations Human Rights Council, in a defining vote, adopted a resolution on June 30, 2016, on “Protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation, and gender identity,” to mandate the appointment of an independent expert on the subject.<strong>[xvii] </strong></p>



<p>It was a historic victory for the human rights of anyone at risk of discrimination and violence because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lately, India’s highest court decision to strike down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial-era law banning gay sex, was a watershed victory in the fight for human rights. Progress like these, naturally, does not happen in a vacuum. India’s verdict directly referenced Nepal’s landmark ruling in 2007, which resulted in legal protection for LGBT+ individuals, as well as official recognition of a third gender. In subsequent years, similar legislation acknowledging a third gender was enacted in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India. Moreover, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have allowed people to change their legal gender.<strong>[xviii]</strong></p>



<p>However, discrimination and abuse against the LGBT+ community are still prevalent in the region. Decriminalization of homosexuality is only the first step of many in the battle for civil rights and wider acceptance.<strong>[xix]</strong></p>



<p>Ensuring that LGBT+ individuals can openly express their sexual orientation and gender identity without being stigmatized, discriminated against, or attacked should be a policy priority, for at least three reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The first and most important reason is obviously ethical.</strong> Sexual orientation and gender identity are integral aspects of ourselves. Guaranteeing that LGBT people are not condemned to forced concealment or retaliation when their identity is revealed should constitute an inalienable human right.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The second reason is economic</strong>. The exclusion of LGBT+ people impedes economic development through a wide range of channels, such as lower investment in human capital, reduced output, and productivity, public spending on social and health services that might be better spent elsewhere.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The third reason why LGBT+ inclusion should constitute a priority is social.</strong> LGBT+ inclusion is viewed as conducive to the emergence of less restrictive gender norms that improve gender equality broadly speaking and, hence, expand social and economic roles, especially for women.<strong>[xx] </strong>Consistent with this intuition, acceptance of homosexuality is strongly correlated with support for gender equality worldwide.</li><li><strong>Making LGBT+ individuals and the discrimination they face visible in national statistics&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>Awarding the world that LGBT+ individuals constitute a sizable minority that is discriminated against is an important prerequisite in order to improve their inclusion. Greater publicity of discriminatory behavior can indeed bring meaningful change, in particular through greater self-control of discriminating individuals.</p>



<p>Collecting information on sexual orientation and gender identity in censuses as well as national labor force, health, and victimization surveys are critical to creating awareness. However, only a minority of OECD countries (15) have included such questions in at least one of their nationally representative surveys, and even fewer (11 countries) do so on a regular basis. Yet, these countries constitute helpful precedents that contribute to disseminate good practices on how to best collect such sensitive information. The United Kingdom is, for instance, planning to include a question on sexual self-identification in its 2021 census.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enforcing Anti-Discrimination and Equality Laws</strong></li></ul>



<p>Legally prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination and ensuring equal rights to LGBT+ individuals is essential for their inclusion. One cannot expect to improve the situation of sexual and gender minorities if, to begin with, the law does not protect them against discrimination and abuses. As an illustration, LGBT+ employees report lower perceived discrimination and are more comfortable being open about their sexual orientation in firms that ban discrimination against them. LGBT+ employees also declare greater job commitment, improved workplace relationships, increased job satisfaction, and better health outcomes in these settings. Recently, the top court in the US has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country&#8217;s civil rights laws.<strong>[xxi]</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Educating People in Countering their Unconscious Biases</strong></li></ul>



<p>Unconscious bias training should constitute a key component of any policy package aiming to improve LGBT+ inclusion. This training consists of making individuals aware of their unconscious prejudices and stereotypes and teaching them how to overcome them. Increasing attention is being devoted to training recruiters, managers, and employees at large.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</h4>



<p>There is still a long way to go before lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender individuals meet full-fledged legal acceptance. LGBT+ people are still stigmatized and exposed to various forms of discrimination, despite the fact that some LGBT+ individuals managed to make it to the top. Discrimination is not only ethically unacceptable; it also entails substantial economic and social costs. Examining violence and discrimination against sexual and gender minority persons will help us understand better, the gendered dynamics behind exclusionary politics and violence. Laws prohibiting same-sex relations are found in the penal codes of many countries in the world. Although few cases are actually prosecuted under these laws, such criminalization contributes to the stigmatization of LGBT individuals in the media, public, and the workplace.</p>
