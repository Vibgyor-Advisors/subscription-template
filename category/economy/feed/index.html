<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>&nbsp;The means of production are owned and controlled by private businesses and the government has no role to play in production or prices. It is also known as a free market economy or free enterprise economy. This economic system is dominant in the Western world, mainly.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy is one of the oldest economic systems in the world which emerged during the 17th century. Capitalist Economy arose from a systematic breakdown of feudalism as a social and economic system and the imposition of a wage-labor system in its place. It first started with merchants who were a link between customer and producer. However, they gradually dominated the latter by placing orders and paying in advance. Then became more powerful by supplying them raw material and paying wages for finished production. The Merchant then made the transition to capitalism by making profits from the ownership and control of means of production. As time passed by, mercantilism gradually evolved into the economic practices that would eventually be called Capitalism. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The Capitalist Economy is the most predominant in the current global economy. The USA, UK, Germany, Japan, Singapore, etc. are the classical examples of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Characteristics of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, private individuals and/or businesses own the capital good, that is, production. The production of goods and services is wholly based on the supply and demand in the market. The private individuals are unrestrained and without any interference from the side of government. They decide on their own as to where to invest the capital, what and how to produce, where and what to sell, and at which prices to exchange the goods and services.</p>



<p>Some of the chief characteristics of a Capitalist Economy could be summarized as:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Economic Freedom:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, every individual is free to make economic choices without any intervention by the government. This freedom applies to both producers and consumers. Producers are free to produce any goods or services as per demand in the market. Similarly, consumers are free to buy the things they desire. Also, the workers are free to take employment wherever they desire and investors are free to invest wherever they get higher profit.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Profit Motive:</strong></h4>



<p>The driving force behind a capitalist economy is the profit motive. Business establishments exist to make a profit. The motive for the production and sale of goods and services is to gain profits and not just to solely satisfy the people&#8217;s needs and desires. The profit motive is responsible for the distribution of resources, determination of the character of the business, and leads to variations in production due to improved and increased technology.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Minimal Government Intervention:</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;Capitalist economic systems are characterized by minimal intervention by the government. Producers and consumers are at liberty to produce and buy goods and services respectively. Government intervention is limited to the protection of private property and the provision of public goods.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Consumer`s Sovereignty:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economy, a consumer is considered as a king. The whole production frameworks as per the directions of consumers. Utilization of resources, the technique of production, and the output, everything<strong> </strong>depends on impersonal force consumer&#8217;s demand. The consumers are at liberty to buy any goods and services as they need and desire. The choice of consumers is not subject to any restraint.</p>



<h4><strong>5. A Two-Class System:</strong></h4>



<p>Under the capitalist economic system, society is divided into two groups of individuals: The capitalist class and the Workers class.</p>



<p>The capitalist class owns the means of production and distribution and purchase the labor power of others. The capitalist class regulates the whole production and distribution process.&nbsp; While the workers class does not own any means of production. They sell their labor to the capitalist class in exchange for wages. However, there exists conflict between the two over the issues of wage payement, working hours, and working conditions. The worker&#8217;s class always remains subordinate to the capitalist class.</p>



<h4><strong>6. Willingness to Change:</strong></h4>



<p>Another character of a capitalist economy is its ability to adapt and change. It allows the change and adaptability of newer tastes of society. It does not stick to a single trend; it changes with the change in society to satisfy the demands of consumers. It also focuses on overcoming inefficiencies within its economic structure.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Advantages of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>In the Capitalist economic system, goods or services are distributed based on mechanisms set by societies, instead of government controls or mandates. The primary advantage of a Capitalist economy is that every individual has some sort of control over their fortune in life. The main benefit of the Capitalist economic system is that it provides strong incentives and motivation to grow, produce, innovate, improve, and move forward constructively. Some of the advantages of the capitalist economy are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>It  leads to innovation<em>:</em></strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy does create conditions for innovations to grow and thrive very quickly, for economic infrastructure to be built with maximum speed, making possible rapid development. &nbsp;Business owners invest in development and research to create better products. To get more profit every producer takes the new initiative to develop new techniques in production. The best example of innovation is the changing shapes and features of cellular mobile phones from hand handled mobile phones to pocket-size cellular phones.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>It is key to success:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Every person residing in a society focused on Capitalist economic systems does have an initial chance to find out success in many ways. Some may work even harder than others as everyone is surely going to get an opportunity at some level. There is one golden principle that if you work hard in your life, you have somehow a chance of reaching your definition of success.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>It  promotes participation:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy encourages people to get involved in all possible aspects of society to create the best outcome for themselves. People quickly get involved with different business activities so that they can get more and more benefits and create more capital.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Capitalist Economy embraces skills:</strong></h4>



<p>There are people with tremendous skills in this world that are not adequately utilized. A capitalist economy allows businesses to tap into these resources so that they can innovate. These innovations also create improving chances to continue for this developing world. This will undoubtedly bring an end to hunger, water scarcity, and other potentially life-threatening conditions.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>It leads to Economic Growth:</strong></h4>



<p>With the business firms and individuals facing incentives to be innovative, this creates a climate of innovation and therefore economic expansion. This in turn helps in an increase in real GDP and leads to improved living standards. In a capitalist economy, economic growth is faster and higher because the investor or the producer invests in the projects that are profitable to him. From a global perspective, before the industrial revolution, almost 80% of the world&#8217;s population lived in poverty. By 1980 that number had fallen to 34.8% and by 2000, less than 20% of the population lives on less than $1 a day. In the average country that became more capitalist over the last 25 years, the average citizen gained a 43% increase in income.</p>



<h4><strong>Disadvantages of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>Despite various merits and advantages of the capitalist economy, there are certain demerits of it. Some of which are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>More emphasis on the needs of business and not on the needs of the individual:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In a capitalist economy emphasis is more laid on the needs of the business rather than the needs of individuals. If companies want to remain operational, then they must introduce innovation in goods or services they offer and should also try to reduce costs. In a capitalist economy, there can be a misallocation of resources which results in higher production of luxury goods, which in turn will make the necessary goods more expensive and out of reach of an individual. Taking an example of some businesses (Telecom or IT or Pharmaceutical Companies, etc.) these are growing in this pandemic also but the common man is still striving for essentials.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Less government interference:</strong></h4>



<p>In a strong capitalist economic society, there is less or no interference of government and due to this the resources available are being utilized by few individuals to create opportunities and it leads to consolidation.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>People with disabilities are neglected:</strong></h4>



<p>The main focus of the Capitalist economy is too non-disabled individuals. If someone is unable to be productive, no matter what either because of injury or disability, they no longer have the ability to contribute and such individuals are left behind.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Competition is dragged into market:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy only focuses on the best. This means that larger businesses with more capital workforce smaller companies that lie out of their niches. It also means that workers with superior skills are forced out to work that usually may have an average based skillset.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Not bothered about the environment and other social structure:</strong></h4>



<p>The primary goal of the Capitalist economy is based mainly on consumption, so almost all of the energy is spent on that particular purpose alone. There is no consideration given to the environmental and social structures of the society, and no responsibility is shown so whatever harm may be done in another area.</p>



<h4><strong>Capitalist Economy Versus Social Economy</strong>:</h4>

<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years, the capitalist economy has evolved. Starting with Feudalism followed by mercantilism and then capitalism. The capitalist economy needs a free market to succeed. Distribution of goods in a capitalist economic system is done according to laws of supply and demand.&nbsp; In a capitalist economy, the best products are generated for the best prices because consumers will pay more for what they want the most. The essential reward of a capitalist economy is the innovation of new products and more efficient production methods. The essential feature of capitalism is the motive to make a profit. In a capitalist economy, there is rational self-interest that can lead to economic growth. However, like anything else, a capitalist economy has its disadvantages too. No doubt that the capitalist economy has surpassed economic growth more than that of other economic systems, but the concentration of wealth in the hands of few always remains controversial. The forces that lead to the success of a capitalist economy may also act as a reason for its failure; it is necessary to take appropriate measures to protect the free market from powerful private interests.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Punishment is the impulse used to authorize the tradition that must be adhered to which goes about as one of the segments of present-day human advancement. It is the obligation of the State to rebuff the crooks so as to keep up peace in the general public. Earlier, there wasn&#8217;t a particular law or request for such violations and the quantum and degree of punishment was to a great extent reliant on the King. With time present-day speculations of punishment were created and intentional accommodation of our privileges and capacity to keep up lawfulness was given to the state. The most severe or we can say the most noteworthy punishment granted in the present time is ‘Capital Punishment’.</p>



<p>Capital punishment is the punishment that includes the legitimate executing of an individual who has perpetrated specific wrongdoing restricted by the law. Capital punishment is also known as the ‘Death Penalty’ which is authorized by the legislature in which an individual is executed by the state as a punishment for the wrongdoing he submitted.</p>



<p>The debate about the death penalty is one of the endless debates of modern times. That it is endless is understandable, for there is death at both ends of the argument: the one who is to be killed at the hands of justice has himself killed, usually at the instigation of his own sense of justice, or (more commonly), injustice. And so, every argument about the preciousness, the sacredness, or the merely secular right to life can be answered with equal force from the other end. Small wonder then that the argument goes in a circle.</p>



<h4><strong>Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>The issue of capital punishment has been discussed, examined, concentrated from a delayed time yet till now no end can be drawn about the maintenance or abolishment of the arrangement. Capital punishment has been a method of punishment for centuries which is rehearsed for the disposal of criminals and is utilized as the discipline for the previous violations.</p>



<p>India is one of the retentionist countries which have retained the death penalty. In India deciding the case for the death penalty is based on the doctrine of ‘rarest of the rare test’ which was stated in the case of Bachan Singh v. the State of Punjab, [i] which means that the death penalty should be awarded in rarest of rare cases. This view of the Supreme Court was highly supported as it aimed to reduce the use of Capital Punishment.</p>



<p>The rationale for the decision applied by the Supreme Court on account of Bachan Singh is that capital punishment is constitutional only if it goes about as an option in contrast to life detainment.&nbsp; Furthermore, the same will be applied in rarest of the rare case at the point when the elective choice of life imprisonment is unquestionable dispossessed.</p>



<p>There has been a differing supposition with respect to capital punishment in India as some are in the opinion of the maintenance of the discipline while others are in the opinion of its abolishment. The individuals who are in the opinion of capital punishment contend that it ought to be given in the most grievous and rarest of the rare violations. However, the individuals who are against the death penalty contend on the religious, good, and moral grounds and announce it inhumane. It is additionally proposed that it ought to be supplanted with life detainment or any substitute must be brought out.</p>



<p><strong>The Constitution of India under Article 21 states</strong> that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. On account of capital punishment when the punishment of death is granted then it additionally restricts the extent of presentation of new realities or laws for the situation. On the off chance that the punishment has been executed, it is permanent.</p>



<h4><strong>Constitutional Validity of Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>The established constitutional validity of capital punishment was tested every once in a while, in various cases beginning from Jagmohan Singh <em>v. </em>State of Uttar Pradesh [ii] where the Supreme Court dismissed the contention that capital punishment is the infringement of the &#8220;right to life&#8221; which is ensured under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.</p>



<p>For another situation, in Rajendra Prasad<em> v. </em>State of Uttar Pradesh, [iii] Justice Krishna Iyer has compassionately focused on that capital punishment is violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21, but year a later in the milestone case of Bachan Singh v. the State of Punjab, [iv] by a dominant majority of 4:1 (Bhagwati J. disagreeing) the Supreme Court overruled its previous decision in Rajendra Prasad case. It communicated the view that capital punishment, as an elective punishment for murder isn&#8217;t absurd and thus violative of Articles 14,19, and 21, of the Constitution of India, in light of the fact that the &#8220;public order&#8221; contemplated by Clauses (2) to (4) of Article 19 is unique in relation to &#8220;law and order&#8221; and furthermore articulated the standard of granting capital punishment just in the &#8220;rarest of rare cases&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly in various other cases, the Supreme Court has given its perspectives on capital punishment and on its established legitimacy. The Supreme Court in Machhi Singh v. the State of Punjab, [v] set out the expansive frameworks of the conditions when capital punishment ought to be imposed.</p>



<p>It is noteworthy to mention that the dissenting judge in the <em>Bachan Singh case, Justice Bhagwati, found the death penalty necessarily arbitrary, discriminatory and capricious. He reasoned that the death penalty in its actual operation is discriminatory, for it strikes mostly against the poor and deprived sections of the community, and the rich and the affluent usually escape, from its clutches. This circumstance also adds to the arbitrary and capricious nature of the death penalty and renders it unconstitutional as being violative of Articles 14 and 21. [vi] However, the majority of the judges, in this case,</em> didn’t agree with this opinion and held capital punishment constitutionally valid.</p>



<h4><strong>Penological Justification for the Death Penalty</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Deterrence</strong></li></ul>



<p>Deterrence aims to prevent individuals from offending by using the fear or threat of punishment [vii]. The assumption behind deterrence theory is that all persons are rational individuals, and will commit a crime only if they perceive that the gain they will derive from the criminal act will be greater than the pain they will suffer from its penal consequences.[viii] The idea is that the activity of deterrence is reinforced when the punishment is made as extreme as death itself; no individual in his/her correct attitude would submit a demonstration which may bring about the loss of one&#8217;s life, the nature of self-protection being inherent, biological and invincible under common conditions.</p>



<p>For deterrence to work, it is necessary that certain prerequisites be met. If anyone of these prerequisites does not exist, or if any of them are weakened, then the overall idea of deterrence fails. These prerequisites can be broadly articulated as follows [ix]:</p>



<ol><li>That potential offenders know which offenses merit the death penalty.</li><li>That potential offenders conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits before or while committing the crime and weigh the death penalty as a serious and important cost.</li><li>That potential offenders view it as a probable consequence that they will be subjected to the death penalty if they commit the crime.</li><li>That potential offenders are risk-averse and not risk-seeking.</li><li>That potential offenders give more weight to the costs than the benefits and choose to not perform the act.</li></ol>



<p>If all the above-mentioned prerequisites are met, then it is assumed that the potential offender will be deterred from offending. However, experts noticed two major fallacies in these assumptions &#8211; Knowledge Fallacies and Rationality Fallacies.</p>



<p>Knowledge fallacies refer to the idea that offenders <em>do not know </em>the penalties applicable to the crimes that they plan on committing. Hence, they do not feel deterred by a severe penalty.</p>



<p>A major assumption of deterrence theory is that potential offenders are rational decision-makers. However, a large number of crimes are committed in a fit of rage or anger, or when the offender is clinically depressed, or are motivated out of strong emotions such as revenge or paranoia. In circumstances such as these, deterrence is unlikely to operate since the actor is not likely to give due weight or even a cursory consideration to what penalties might be imposed on him/her subsequently; the focus is on the emotion driving his/her state of mind. [x]</p>



<p>The discussion above does not imply that deterrence is a myth and the criminal justice system could do away with all punishments entirely, without impacting deterrence. Indeed, the fact that there exists<em> </em>a criminal justice system that punishes criminal conduct is by itself a deterrent. Consequently, it is not necessary that punishments by themselves be harsh or excessive. Theorists argue that the assumption in criminal law that the harsher the punishment, the less likely it is to be committed is not true.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incapacitation</strong></li></ul>



<p>The theory of incapacitation advocates dealing with offenders in such a way that they are not in a position to re-offend. It is generally used as a justification to impose longer sentences on repeat offenders, dangerous criminals, or career criminals. To be able to use the incapacitation rationale, it is essential that the sentencing court make an assessment of the ‘dangerousness’ of the offender and the possibility that the person is likely to re-offend.</p>



<p>The primary objection to executing a person on grounds of incapacitation is the predictability problem. It is virtually impossible to be able to predict if the convicted offender is likely to re-offend. Capital punishment is the most extreme form of incapacitation since it implies taking the life of the offender to ensure that he/she does not re-offend.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reformation</strong></li></ul>



<p>The theory of reformation strives to transform all offenders into peaceful, productive, and capable citizens of society. Reformation assumes that offenders are capable of change, and once the reasons for the commission of the crime are removed, they can lead ordinary and fulfilling lives.</p>



<p>While it is clear that when a person is sentenced to death, the idea of reformation has clearly lost its priority in sentencing, discussions of reformation have often been a part of death penalty adjudication. This is because reformation is a central normative commitment of our criminal justice system, and because only those offenders who are adjudged beyond reform and proven to be so, through conclusive evidence adduced by the prosecution, can ever be sentenced to death.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Public Opinion</strong></li></ul>



<p>An important reason often cited by governments for retaining the death penalty is that public opinion demands the same. One could argue that public opinion is indeed a factor to be considered while making important decisions that affect the population at large. However, it is not necessary for the government to follow public opinion on every issue.</p>



<p>The Indian experience of laws governing social issues, such as Sati, dowry prohibition, untouchability, and child marriage is a testament to the fact that the government has the power to lead public opinion even against deeply entrenched cultural norms and indeed an obligation to do so when faced with issues concerning human dignity and equality.</p>



<h4><strong>Contemporary Reports commenting on Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>Recent expansions of the scope of the death penalty, for example, passed in 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act introduced several new provisions into the Indian Penal Code, including Section 376A, which allowed for the death penalty to be imposed in cases where rape led to the death of the victim or left her in a persistent vegetative state; and 376E which allowed for the imposition of the death penalty for certain repeat offenders. These amendments were passed in the wake of the recommendations of the Verma Committee.[xi] Pertinently, while the Verma Committee was in favor of enhanced punishment for certain forms of sexual assault and rape, it noted that “in the larger interests of society, and having regard to the current thinking in favor of the <em>abolition of the death penalty, and also to avoid the argument of any sentencing arbitrariness, we are not inclined to recommend the death penalty.</em>” The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, nevertheless expanded the scope of the death penalty.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>India’s Law Commission in its 262<sup>nd</sup> Report (August 2015) </strong>recommended that the concept of the death penalty should be abolished for all crimes other than terrorism-related offenses to safeguard national security.</p>



<p>The Law Commission in its past report in the year 1967, Commission finished up that India couldn&#8217;t change the &#8220;analysis of abrogation of the death penalty&#8221;. However, in 2015 the Commission expressed that &#8220;the Commission feels that the time has arrived for India to move towards abrogation of capital punishment&#8221;. Further, it was mentioned, “The social, economic and cultural contexts of the country have changed drastically since the 35<sup>th</sup> Report” (1967).</p>



<p>Moreover, arbitrariness has remained a major concern in the adjudication of death penalty cases in the past years since the foremost precedent on the issue was laid down.</p>



<h4><strong>Rate of Execution and Commutation of Capital Punishment in India</strong></h4>



<p>In India, the concept of the death penalty is present but there were only 11 executions done from the year 1998-2019. In the last 20 years, a total of 3751 death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment.</p>



<p>After handing out 186 death sentences in 2018 — a 20-year high — the number of capital punishments given out at trial courts in 2019 declined sharply to 102.</p>



<p>There is a clear focus on the perpetrators of sexual crimes as particularly “deserving” of the death penalty. However, there is no evidence that adding the death penalty for rape under certain circumstances has acted as a deterrent. In fact, the number of rape-murders increased between 2017 and 2018. [xii]</p>



<p>Data gathered by the National Crimes Record Bureau on death sentences indicates that in the period between 2000 and 2012, <strong>1677 death sentences were imposed by Indian courts</strong>. This implies that India sends on average 129 persons to death row every year, or roughly <strong>one person every third day. </strong>This number is alarmingly high and appeared to suggest that the death penalty is being applied much more widely than was envisaged by the Bachan Singh case.</p>



<h4><strong>The Fallibility of the Criminal Justice System and the Death Penalty</strong></h4>



<p>In the last decade, the Supreme Court has on numerous occasions expressed concern about arbitrary sentencing in death penalty cases.</p>



<p>In Rampalb Pithwa Rahidas v. the State of Maharashtra, [xiii] where the trial court sentenced 8 persons to death and the high court confirmed the death sentence against 5 of them, the Supreme Court acquitted all the accused, on the ground that the main evidence against them – that of an approver – was not reliable.</p>



<p>So also, in Subash Chander &amp; others <em>v. </em>Krishan Lal &amp; others, [xiv] where the trial court convicted the four accused and sentenced three of them to death, and the High Court upheld the conviction but commuted the sentence of all to life, the Supreme Court acquitted all the accused.</p>



<p>Again, in Parmananda Pegu v. the State of Assam, [xv] the lower courts had imposed the death sentence on the accused while the Supreme Court acquitted the accused.</p>



<p>The above-mentioned cases and many more like these stand the question that each judge can only limit his analysis to the cases he has presided over or read about. In light of the large volumes of cases, the determination that one or the other case is a “rarest of rare case” would remain nothing but a legal fiction. Whether a law that permits the taking of life on the basis of legal fiction, is in consonance with the text and spirit of the Constitution, bears investigation.</p>



<p>It is noteworthy to mention here that anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to appeal to a court of higher jurisdiction, and steps should be taken to ensure that such appeals shall become mandatory. Also, Clemency powers in India are enshrined in the Constitution. Article 72 vests these powers in the President, and Article 161 vests similar powers in the Governors of the States. Clemency powers mean either pardoning the offender or reducing or altering the punishment awarded by the Court.</p>



<h4><strong>International Trends and Deterrence</strong></h4>



<p>Today, 106 countries had abolished the death penalty in law for all crimes by the end of 2017 and 142 countries had abolished the death penalty in law or practice. [xvi] A category of countries has also abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes such as murder and retained it for exceptional crimes such as crimes under military law or under exceptional circumstances.</p>



<p>When a death penalty is awarded it eliminates the scope of improvement which could have changed the life of an individual, this is the reason why democracies around the world are supporting the reformative theory of punishment and abolishing the deterrent theory of punishment. The death penalty is most prominently used in Iran, China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, and the USA.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The death penalty does not serve the penological goal of deterrence any more than life imprisonment. Further, life imprisonment under Indian law means imprisonment for the whole of life subject to just remissions which, in many states in cases of serious crimes, are granted only after many years of imprisonment which range from 30-60 years.</p>



<p>Retribution has an important role to play in punishment. However, it cannot be reduced to vengeance. The notion of ‘an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth’ has no place in the constitutionally mediated criminal justice system. Capital punishment fails to achieve any constitutionally valid penological goals.</p>



<p>In focusing on the death penalty as the ultimate measure of justice to victims, the restorative and rehabilitative aspects of justice are lost sight of. Reliance on the death penalty diverts attention from other problems ailing the criminal justice system such as poor investigation, crime prevention, and rights of victims of crime.</p>



<p>In retaining and practicing the death penalty, India forms part of a small and ever-dwindling group of nations. That 142 countries are now abolitionist in law or in practice, demonstrates that evolving standards of human dignity and decency do not support the death penalty. The international trend towards successful and sustained abolition also confirms that retaining the death penalty is not a requirement for effectively responding to the insurgency, terror, or violent crime.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“A revolution is not a bed of roses. A revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>                                                 ~Fidel Castro</em></strong></p>



<h3><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>On a December day in 2010, <strong>Mohamed Bouazizi</strong>, a Tunisian street vendor, stood in front of a Government office and set himself on fire, killing himself. Bouazizi had been harassed by cops who attempted to shut down his business with no recourse, and his suicide by self-immolation galvanized Tunisian protesters. His actions helped spark a revolutionary uprising that has come to be known as the <strong>‘Arab Spring’</strong>. Protesters demonstrated against Government corruption and Tunisia’s autocratic president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. A month later, after 23 years in power, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This raised hopes among millions of other citizens within the neighboring Arab countries. Thus, within a short period, the protests spread to other countries like Algeria, Libya, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Yemen, and some other Gulf countries. The demands of the protesters varied from country to country but in general, it included demands for political freedom, social freedom, press freedom, improved human rights conditions, economic betterment, etc. The demands reflect a desire among the masses, particularly the new generation of young and educated, to be liberated from the reins of the old and authoritarian leadership and play a role in the decision-making process of the state. So far, the protests have overthrown four long-serving dictators — <strong>Ben Ali</strong> of <strong>Tunisia</strong>, <strong>Hosni Mubarak </strong>of <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Muammar Gaddafi</strong> of <strong>Libya</strong>, and <strong>Ali Abdullah Saleh</strong> of <strong>Yemen</strong>. While the Bashar Al Assad regime in Syria is struggling for its survival, other countries have successfully managed to suppress the protests against the regimes either by a crackdown or by promising economic and political reforms.</p>



<h4><strong>Why the name ‘Arab Spring’?</strong></h4>



<p>The name “Arab Spring” is a reference to the 1848 Revolution- also known as the “People’s spring” – when political upheavals swept Europe. Ever since the word “spring” has been used to describe movements towards democracy like Czechoslovakia’s 1968 “Prague Spring”. Western media started popularizing the term “Arab Spring” in 2011.</p>



<h4><strong>Who was Mohamed Bouazizi?</strong></h4>



<p>Mohamed Bouazizi was a Tunisian street vendor from the village of Sidi Salah. Bouazizi was three years old when his father died. In the village in his small room, he was educated with his six siblings. To provide basic needs and necessities to his family he left education in his early teens but always dreamt of completing high school. He was the sole earner of the family besides supporting his mother, uncle, younger siblings. He applied for the military but was rejected.</p>



<p>In December 2010, Bouazizi (who was now 26 years old) was getting ready to sell fruits and vegetables. He was stopped by police for not having the necessary permit to sell products. He was humiliated by Faida Hamdy, a female police officer who allegedly slapped him, confiscated his weighing scales, and pushed over his cart. He requested the return of scales to the Governor but was however rejected. Governor even refused to see him despite his threats that he would burn himself.</p>



<p>After his request was turned away, he marched to a Government building and set himself on fire. Before setting himself on fire, he shouted “how do you expect me to make a living”. Although people tried to save him, he was having 90% burn injuries on his body. The President of Tunisia came to see him in the hospital and promised that he will send him to France for treatment but no such transfer was arranged. After remaining 18 days in a comatose state he died in January 2011. Thousands attended his funeral and pledged to avenge his death.</p>



<h4><strong>Aftermath of Bouazizi’s Death</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Tunisia</strong></li></ul>



<p>After the self-immolation of Bouazizi, the Tunisians took to the streets and began demonstrating which was captured by cell phone cameras and shared on the internet. Western Media started popularizing it as ‘Arab Spring’. Within days, protests started popping up across the country, calling upon President Ben Ali and his regime to step down. A brutal security crackdown followed, reported in shocking details by online social media. When protests reached the capital, Tunis, the government responded with even more brutality, arresting demonstrators, activists, and shutting down the Internet. This act marked the end of one of the Arab world&#8217;s most repressive regimes. It was a victory for people power and perhaps the first time ever in history that an Arab dictator has been removed by a revolution instead of a coup d’état.</p>



<p>About a month later, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. A democratic free election was held to choose members of the council in which all the Tunisians participated. The members were given the task of drafting a new constitution and the democratically chosen Prime Minister and President took oath and office.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8g0IXXbkox_QyLQ8cHql5WPZ7lv_8QLwiv4FaAfs8pBz5vP6S_yfWL3guUmBkgMqccZJzS8D62LbVG3pd0LEVt_Ut1rXMH3v19s33nAQMeasBSKKzVCOc72_keI6jEREixPWaA" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\tunis.PNG"/></figure>



<p>Tunisians protest outside the gates of the French Embassy in Tunis. Arab Spring began in Tunisia when a fruit vendor set himself on fire in protest in front of a government building.</p>



<p>After Tunisia protests began to spread to other countries like Libya, Yemen, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Egypt</strong></li></ul>



<p>In late January of the same year (i.e. 2011), massive protests broke out in Egypt only after a few days of the ouster of Ben Ali’s in Tunisia. To control protests the Egyptian government started cracking down violently against the demonstrators. After several days of massive demonstrations and clashes between the security forces and protesters in Cairo and around the country, a turning point came when the Egyptian army announced that it would not use force against the protesters and started calling for the removal of President Hosni Mubarak. After military withdrawal support, the president left office after nearly 30 years, and the senior military officers ceded to the power.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DgRzF6lAmcV57j3ZFvKGi8icuQOdQr_e8EFMSfnhlniGe9hEOB-XIEVwIS2yuWDamnP-IDs3obkzImbOMo78omodcsg0OzlZEGlFBRJJ377YAzKAbKXvu0moHWSRKbvj2K7k4g" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\hosni mubarak.PNG"/></figure>

<p>A great role played by the military in ending the Mubarak regime has led the new military administration to enjoy high public approval. However, the new administration appeared hesitant to transfer full powers to an elected government and the use of force was resumed by military and security forces against the protesters. In late November 2011 despite this multiday outbreak of violence, the parliamentary elections were held and after a year People’s Assembly- a newly elected assembly held its inaugural session.</p>

<p>After the rapid successes in protest movements in Tunisia and Egypt, the protest movements took hold in Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, and Syria.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Syria</strong></li></ul>



<p>In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, the civil war began that lasted for several years, forcing many to leave Syria to seek refuge in Turkey, Greece, and throughout Western Europe. For a time, the militant group ISIS had declared a caliphate (a nation that is governed by Islamic Law) in northern Syria. This group has executed thousands of people there, and many others fled the region in fear of their lives.</p>



<p>Although the ISIS group has largely been defeated in Syria, yet the oppressive regime of long term dictator Bashar al Assad remains in power in the country. The infrastructure of the country has suffered significant damage, and the conflict has devolved into tribal warfare.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6mPCYM6MaRM_kmjCeGCWMFwlRgnP12LhFRhceqH2y1PkKn8vHkj2J5CBdgBCUh-nDEnZ15h_T5NDqfd-NLwMX8Cf6ExpVphSWiGE6HFtPYWyWLqFJDHJHPsR0eBvL7JjFwmRwg" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\syria.PNG"/></figure>



<p><em>Protesters burn images of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2012, protest</em>. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Libya</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Libya, Muammar Gaddafi (authoritarian dictator Colonel) was overthrown in 2011, during a violent civil war. He was tortured (literally dragged through the streets) and was executed by opposition fighters. However, since his downfall, Libya has remained in a state of civil war, and the two opposing governments rule separate regions of the country. During the years of political upheaval, the civilian population has suffered significantly, with violence in the streets and access to food, resources, and healthcare services severely limited.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t6_HaoK98y9E-lO5RpHtmrxRC-JyfpofNEHhpM1l5N8C0zFrCbANZmPFnjWtmwpLP9-1-hndD2a8WPR_6_TMa2BT1m7dBXmJJfZ94rXhSpvim6WUx6k4G8ZuAyYO06_EKAMbdg" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\libya.PNG"/></figure>



<p><em>A rebel firing a gun in the heavily contested city of Ajdābiyā in eastern Libya, 2011. The graffiti on the side of the truck reads, “Army of Libya.”</em></p>



<p>This has contributed to the ongoing worldwide refugee crisis, which has seen thousands of Libyan fleeing the country, most often by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, with hopes of new opportunities in Europe.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Bahrain</strong></li></ul>



<p>The reforms in Tunisia and Egypt prompted the other countries to rise against the dictatorship, corruption, and other issues. In February 2011, Bahrain Human Rights activists and members of Bahrain marginalized Shiite majority protested and demanded political and economic reforms in Bahrain. The Bahrain security forces along with forces from Saudi Arabia and UAE violently suppressed the protestors. Dozens of accused protest leaders were imprisoned; hundreds of Shiite workers fired and Shiite mosques in dozens were demolished by the government&#8217;s aftermath protest. An independent investigation commissioned by the Bahraini government concluded that excessive force and torture has been used against the protesters by the government. The government assured us to act on the report in which recommendations for reformation were included.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Yemen</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Yemen, the first protest appeared in late January of 2011. President Ali Abd Allah Salih’s base of support was damaged when a number of the country’s most powerful tribal and military leaders aligned together with the pro-democracy protesters calling for him to step down. But they failed to remove Salih from power. In June, he was injured in a bomb attack and he left Yemen to receive medical treatment, raising hopes among the opposition that a transition would begin. Four months later when Salih returned to the country added to the uncertainty and confusion about Yemen’s political future. He signed an internationally mediated agreement in November of the same year in which he agreed for a phased transfer of power to the then-Vice President, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Accordingly, Hadi took over governing responsibility and formally assumed the Presidency after standing as the sole candidate in a presidential election in 2012.</p>

<p><em>Yemeni demonstrators calling for President ʿAlī ʿAbd Allah Ṣāliḥ to step down.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Social Media and Revolutions</strong></h4>



<p>Social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and mobile telephones played a major role in spreading information and serving as a mobilizing tool for the spontaneous and organic gathering of protesters during the Arab Spring across the MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) region in early 2011. Images of Tunisian protests against social and economic inequities and the regime’s oppression of people, which were widely shared on social media and through mobile telephone devices, inspired and created anti-government protesters in other countries in the region. Authoritarian regimes have often cut off access to the Internet to quell the protests; though they have failed to stop them.</p>



<p>Tweets, texts, videos, blogs, and Facebook pages became the most effective communication and mobilizing tools for young Arab demonstrators. Social media was key to shaping the political debate of the Arab Spring. Political discussions and calls for change happened not only inside Arab states but also across borders of the MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) region. Social media conversations of protesters in Tunisia and Egypt were continued in other countries. And thanks to the Internet, social media, and mobile phones, images, and conversations of protests quickly reached the world, erasing global information borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although digital technology has been a powerful tool for political and social mobilization, this tumultuous and chaotic decade in the Arab world showed that no real change will happen if repressive regimes are more bent on killing their citizens than making any compromise. If before 2011 the authoritarian governments in MENA have not fully understood how to use social media, by the end of the decade they have skillfully weaponized digital media to spread misinformation and propaganda to maintain control and smear and discredit dissidents, shut down the Internet when it suits them, and intimidate and jail online activists in hopes to curb dissent. Social media became a double-edged sword for forces seeking positive change and maintaining the status quo.</p>



<h4><strong>Impacts of Arab Spring</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Climate Change</strong></li></ul>



<p>MENA is one of the most vulnerable regions of the world to climate change. Shortages of freshwater, drought, desertification, extreme heat and dust storms have already shown the region’s climate trajectory during this decade. Climate change was a contributing factor to the Arab Spring. Crop failures, food shortages, and higher food prices worsened the living conditions of the masses, forcing many of them to move within and beyond the borders of their countries in pursuit of a better life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a study published in the Global Environmental Change journal, there was a strong connection between climate change and conflicts in MENA between 2010 and 2012. For example, severe droughts in Syria between 2006 and 2011 decimated agriculture and caused a major migration of farmers to cities. Competition over scarce resources worsened the living conditions of Syrians, who began demanding change from their government.</p>



<p>Subsequent protests against corruption, poverty, and the authoritarian rule of President Bashar al-Assad started one of the most brutal civil wars of the 21st century, which continues to this day. Over these years, power shortages under extreme heat have triggered mass unrest in Iraq and Egypt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instability and conflict in MENA will be closely tied to climate change in the coming years. German research organization, the Max Planck Institute, predicts that daytime temperatures may reach and stay at 50 degrees Celsius throughout each year in MENA by the end of the century. According to its findings, large areas of MENA may become unlivable by then, if global emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mass Migration</strong></li></ul>



<p>The most prominent feature of the past decade was the start of an enormous global refugee crisis. By the end of the decade, there were more refugees than after the end of World War II. The Syrian war created some of the worst refugees’ crisis in the world. Almost 6 million Syrians fled their country since 2011, and more than 6 million remain internally displaced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The largest number of refugees in Europe have come from Syria. However, despite the spike in the number of asylum seekers in Europe, the biggest burden of helping refugees has fallen in developing countries with weak economies and fragile social stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan received the highest numbers of refugees from Syria in proportion to their populations. Besides, Lebanon and Jordan host more than 2 million Palestinian refugees. Refugees continue to put stress on the social and economic stability of these three countries. More developed and rich Arabian Gulf countries could do more to help refugees in and from MENA than they have done so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sectarian Divisions</strong></li></ul>



<p>One of the most defining events in MENA this decade was the deepening Sunni-Shia schism, intensified by ideological competition between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. During this period, Saudi Arabia, which sees itself as the leader of Sunni Muslims, has stepped up its efforts to contain the growing influence of Iran in MENA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The competition between these two countries over spheres of influence has exacerbated regional hostilities. Saudi Arabia and Iran turned the civil conflicts in Syria and Yemen into protracted bloody proxy wars with no end in sight. Iran’s disproportionate influence on Iraq and the powerful Shiite militia group Hezbollah in Lebanon has also inflamed internal tensions in these countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/qatar-blockade-gulf-crisis-190604220901644.html">cut diplomatic and commercial ties</a>&nbsp;with Qatar in 2017 and imposed a complete blockade on it for its alleged close ties with Iran and for “support of terrorism.” The blockade is still in place. Partly because of these events, Qatar withdrew from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2019, after a sixty-year membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being the world’s major exporters of oil and gas and members of OPEC, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also clashed over the direction of OPEC’s energy policy. Iran often opposed Saudi Arabia-dominated OPEC oil prices and the decision to coordinate prices with non-OPEC countries, such as Russia, which now commands a major influence on the oil cartel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia and Iran continue their bitter regional rivalry through proxy wars, exchange accusations about attacks on strategic objects – such as oil tankers and oil facilities, and supply arms to various militia groups in the region, they have avoided having a direct confrontation so far. With no signs of abating, the Saudi-Iranian cold war is likely to exacerbate the sectarian divisions in MENA for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The Arab Spring protests started in the Middle East because of the repression of people and their rights, the insistence of regimes on a monopoly of power and refusal of regimes to accept the transition power principle through elections, as well as poverty, corruption, unemployment, and marginalization of ethnic and youth groups. Arab dictatorships disgraced their own people and their arrogance went far enough. They used to pass reign by inheritance to their sons. They exploited the resources of the countries and shared it between their family members, friends, and relatives while the common people left in underdevelopment and poverty.</p>



<p>The power of peaceful protests and mass demonstrations through uprisings and the ability of social media had fuelled the protests and communicated its goals to the world. The uproar, turmoil, and tumult of the Arab Spring have shown the rest of the world that millions of people in Islamic nations believe in democratic government and free expression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben Ali ruled Tunisia for 20 years, Mubarak reigned in Egypt for 30 years, and Gaddafi held Libya in a tight grip for 40 years. Yet their bravest challengers were 20-30 years old without ideological baggage, violent intentions, or clear leadership. The groups that initiated and sustained protests had few meaningful experiences with public deliberation or voting and little experience with successful protests. However, these young activists were politically disciplined, pragmatic, and collaborative.</p>



<p>The revolution that started in Tunisia spread strongly to five countries. Now against the government, the citizens have the freedom to speak without any reprisal and democratic elections are taking place. The protests, demonstrations, uprisings try to put an end to the repression of free speech, and economic mismanagement, human rights abuses, and corruption.</p>



<p>The Dictators in Yemen, Libya, and Syria launched a war against their own people. No one can predict what will happen as the war is still on in Syria but one thing is clear that the people have come out in massive protest and have broken the barrier of fear. The protestors started peaceful protests however rulers confronted it by massive and excessive force and violence. Libya, Yemen, and Egypt have proven that it will not be an easy task to say where these revolutions are heading.</p>



<p>The revolutions of the Arab Spring are inspiring revolutions worldwide. The failure of the West system and the double standard policy of the West have encouraged the Arabs to adopt the modern pragmatic Islamic approach and discourage the adoption of western values. The game of the west replacing the dictators of the past with the new ones will not survive for long. And finally the masses, the young generation have promised and learned lessons and they will not give up until they achieve their all the basic and human rights.</p>



<p>This has brought the region a novel contour – a wave of protests for democratic reforms in an otherwise authoritarian Arab world. The regime change also carries with it the potentials of change in policies towards the neighborhood and beyond. Throughout the uprisings, the major regional countries have fought political and diplomatic wars among themselves aiming to assert their influence over the region. The outside powers have taken the opportunity to strengthen their interests by intervening in the conflicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the prospect of democracy within the region has receded. Most regimes have been able to keep at bay, at least for the time being, the calls for change. The expectations of the movement turned out to be overambitious. Arab spring is now commonly referred to as Arab winter (reflecting the failure of protest movements to bring about change within the region). Democracy may not have come fully to these countries as expected, yet the region has nevertheless changed dramatically in the last three years. The regimes have survived, but there is no surety of how long they will survive. The internal and external environment has changed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>South Korea is situated in East <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Asia" class="rank-math-link">Asia</a> and is the neighbouring country of Japan. It is on 45% of the southern portion of the Korean peninsula,&nbsp; bordered by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). The capital of South Korea is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Seoul" class="rank-math-link">Seoul (Sŏul). South Korea has an ancient history and has come a long way since the Korean War, which ended in 1953. Despite the miserable conditions brought by War South Korea has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest economies in the 1990s. South Korea even joined the OECD(Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). No doubt, the country has </a>suffered grave economic poverty but it has emerged as a fully functioning modern democracy and one of Asia’s most prosperous countries by today.</p>



<h4><strong>History of South Korea</strong></h4>



<p>Around 668 A.D. various competing Kingdoms were unified into a single regime on the Korean Peninsula. These succeeding dominions maintained Korean political and cultural independence for almost a thousand years. The last of the ruling powers were the Choson Dynasty until the nineteenth century. Korea has survived many invasions by Japan and the Manchus of East Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the end of the 19th century, Korea made small success in relation to trade and diplomatic relations with western powers. By the beginning of the 20th century Japan, Russia, and China competed to take over the Korean Peninsula. Japan succeeded and annexed it over 5 years later after the Russo- Japanese War. This colonial rule was up to 35 years and after the Japanese were defeated in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union divided this peninsula into two zones. After two years, the pro-U.S. The Republic of Korea (or South Korea) was established with its capital Seoul. In the north, the Soviets put Kim II Sung as the first chief of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), better known as North Korea. South Korea’s announcement of independence in 1950 led North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, to occupy its neighbor in an attempt to recover control of the entire peninsula. U.S. and United Nations troops fought beside South Korean forces in the <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.history.com/topics/korean-war">Korean War</a>, which cost some 2 million lives before it ended in 1953.</p>



<h4><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Social Progress</strong></h4>



<p>According to EAI Issue Briefing on “South Korea’s Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Better Life For Girls Initiative” by Eun Mee Kim, the South Korean administration has promised to make up to Sustainable development goals. In its development, cooperative policies, and implementation plans, it has mentioned that it will implement SDGs to the fullest. Even Before the beginning of the SDG era South Korea announced various initiatives they would implement while aiming for achieving SDGs. Many of these initiatives have come up because of South Korea’s own experience. Various initiatives like the New Village Movement, support for education and global citizenship education and global health security, poverty reduction, social-economic development. “Better Life For Girls”&nbsp; is considered an important factor to promote healthcare and education for girls.</p>



<p>East&nbsp; Asia is the leading subregion on the eradication of poverty and hunger in accordance with SDGs 1 and 2 of the United Nations. However, in respect of SDGs 11, 13, and 15 i.e., sustainable cities and communities, climate action, and life on land respectively, East Asia has declined in East Asia since 2000. All measured targets in Goals 4,5,7,11,12,13, and 14 which are quality education, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water respectively, can only be achieved through rigorous efforts with the situation needing a dramatic turnaround. At the Indicator level, the top five target that is in need of correction are protection of forests and ocean health, formal and informal education and training, the concentration of air pollutants, and the number of refugees.</p>

<h4><strong>Comparative Study of Exponential Growth</strong></h4>



<p>Measures are taken and the Government’s role; According to the Economic History Association, The Economic History of Korea is divided into three periods;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The period of Malthusian stagnation up to 1910, when Japan annexed Korea;</li><li>The colonial period from 1910-45, when the country embarked upon modern economic growth; and&nbsp;</li><li>The post-colonial decades, when living standards improved rapidly in South Korea.</li></ol>



<p>South Korean policymakers revived economic growth by encouraging native industrial films following other developing countries. The government targeted certain firms and gave them the privilege to buy foreign currencies and to borrow funds from banks at favorable rates. It also eradicated the tax barriers and imposed a ban on manufacturing imports with the hope that it would provide protection to the domestic firms and give them a chance to improvise their productivity through training and importing advanced technologies. In the 1990s&nbsp; relaxing Capital accounts followed which caused rapid accumulation of short-term external debts. This, together with a highly leveraged corporate sector and the banking sector destabilized by the financial repression, provided the background to the contagion of the financial crisis from Southeast Asia in 1997.</p>



<p>South Korean economy grew at an average annual rate of nearly 9% during the last three decades and per capita income increased more than a hundredfold. South Korea got transformed into an industrial power because of highly skilled labor. Economic Growth was seen to be slowed in the late 20th century. In 1997 South Korea was forced to accept a $57 billion bailout from the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Monetary-Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), which is considered to be the largest rescue in the history of IMF. The country also changed the system of large families who owned business to liberalizing its economy. However, the country recovered its economic growth in the following years and the country gained its economic growth comparatively as it entered the 21st century.</p>



<p>With the growth of educational institutions, commercial and industrial enterprises, many people fled towards urban areas from rural areas. In particular, Seoul grew almost 10 fold to about 1o million people at the beginning of the 21st century. The same sort of growth was seen in the media sector, especially newspaper and magazine publishing. A purposive program was also initiated for the country&#8217;s transportation system to expand and modernize it.</p>



<p>The apparent social change in South Korea was the emergence of the middle class. Even a new elite class emerged from the habitual landholding class after the Land reform measures taken in the early 1950s and with the spread of modern education, which eventually vanished the once privileged Yangban (landholding) Class. As people migrated to urban areas there was a decline of the extended- family system as they started living in apartments as nuclear families and with family planning such significant social change took place.</p>



<p>In regard to Women Empowerment, there were campaigns held by women for complete legal equality and even were succeeded to get enhanced property ownership rights, the right to register as ahead of the family in a new family register system (hojŏk) that took effect in 2008. Under the older system, only men and their children were legally part of the father&#8217;s family register but not the mother. The introduction of the new system increased women’s legal standing in other matters as well be it divorce or child custody cases or in matters of inheritance (adopted and stepchildren rights to be equal to those of biological children).&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the early 21st century, South Korea achieved the aim of decreasing birth rates and less aging population by rapid urbanization, nuclear family system, and women’s active participation in the economy and lengthening life expectancies. The overall population is expected to decrease in the next decades as the government was concerned that fewer children and an aging society would slow economic growth and destabilize the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-security-government-program">social security</a> system in the future.</p>

<h4><strong>South Korea&#8217;s Developmental Model as an Inspiration for other Countries</strong></h4>



<p>South Korea is known for its fast economic development. It is perceived that one should learn from the developmental strategies of Korea. South Korea&#8217;s economic strategy began with an agricultural-based economy in the 1960s and became the 12th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP(Gross Domestic Product) by 2020. South Korea&#8217;s economic success is attributed to policy reforms involving opening the country to foreign markets. Export-orientated policies were an important factor in economic growth. South Korea is among the top 10 exporters in the world and its export percentage was reported at 44.01 % in 2018. An improvement in the business environment and Policies incentivizing investment in innovation were factors that have contributed to the increase in international trade and industrialization in South Korea. Such factors played an important role in uplifting investment, production, communication, and, eventually, economic growth, innovation, and technology being South Korean major factors establishing export competitiveness and led to the country&#8217;s significant economic rise over the past decades. The Human Resource Development, The adaptation of An Outward-Looking Strategy (Labor Intensive Manufacturing), and Raising funds to foster needed industrial development led to the Economic Booming in South Korea.</p>



<p>Other countries cannot achieve fast growth by just following Korean strategies as the economic, social, and political environment of each developing country are different. And there are strategies adopted by Korea which were important factors of growth but later on created problems. As every country has its own unique environment, it is not possible for them to adopt such strategies precisely but can follow some part of it after well consideration keeping in view their resources and infrastructures.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>South Korea is one of the fastest-growing economies in the World. Despite the Korean war which rendered the country poor in a miserable condition, thus the country was not only fighting for economic problems but for survival. South Korea managed to be the 12th largest economy in the World. Major factors in the Country’s economic development involve high levels of domestic savings, private domestic investments, and rapidly growing human capital. The Economic Booming of South Korea drives the attention of developing countries to follow their strategy. Considering South Korea’s relatively limited geographical size, natural resources, and population size, an aging population increases the threat that South Korea’s economy might have a downfall. South Korea needs to continue its support in innovation and a favorable business environment for the maintenance of sustainable economic growth.</p>
