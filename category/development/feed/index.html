<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Data privacy is of greater importance in a world with ever-growing mountains of big data. During the earlier times, the consumers used to share their personal information or data via the offline platform where the chances of data privacy risks were minimal, however, with the growing technology, the consumers in this digital age share their vital information on the online platform, be it on social media sites, E-commerce sites and other Apps to perform certain kind of actions.</p>



<p>The concept of data privacy in this modern era is usually applied to critical personal information also known as Personally Identifiable Information. Such information is used for the purpose of identification of any person like the driver’s license number, bank account number, passport number, etc. and Personal Health Information in a medical record used for the identification of any person which was disclosed, created, or used in the course of providing a health care service. Of late with such a sensitive and personal data record, it becomes challenging when it attempts to use the data while protecting an individual’s personally identifiable information and privacy preferences.</p>



<h4><strong>Digitization of Services</strong></h4>



<p>While the consumers are sharing personal data on online platforms that collect growing amounts of information on the one hand, they have started visualising the danger in such data collection on the other hand. Data privacy has become more important in this digitalized world and those platforms collecting the vital information of an individual should be highly concerned with their data privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy </strong></h4>



<p>Primarily, privacy is the Right of a citizen of being free from public scrutiny or from having one’s personal information shared. Data Privacy is the right of the citizen to have control over how one’s personal information is collected and used. It deals with the practices which ensure that the data so shared by any person must be used for its intended purpose.</p>



<p>Most of the time, Data privacy is confused with Data security and is used interchangeably however, data privacy and data security are, by no means, the same terms.</p>



<p>Like, if you are using a Google Gmail account, your password would be a method of data security, while the way Google uses your data to administer your account would be data privacy.</p>



<p>Data security is a prerequisite to Data privacy therefore it is possible to have healthy security stand without addressing data privacy. However, it is not possible to ensure Data privacy without a solid security stand.</p>

<h4><strong>Data Privacy and Data Security</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2KHHHno84GIoPLml6egdIRtC3qUwPZSL9bAKfZaUI1VWU8IUNmof27Admq_NK2yVjxZIS5V95hg2b2ptpcoDxvZ5M5ZubUSfsGNUFk6iWz8uzI2TAcx6drqZDb3ER5cDDYjETP8g" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy a Real Major Concern</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In this age of digitization, personal data influences a lot of our activities. It affects nearly everything including from what content or messages we see on the internet to so many decisions made whether it’s about a job, a license, or a loan and thereby sway almost every aspect of our lives. Since the autonomy and control over our lives are one of the hallmarks of freedom which would be rendered useless if the important decisions about our lives are being made without our participation which might turn out to be one of the reasons which give rise to data privacy concerns.</p>



<p><strong>Various types of personal information that often come under privacy concerns may be listed as follows;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Financial Information</strong></h4>



<p>Any financial information which is shared online or offline is sensitive as it can be used maliciously by someone to commit fraud. In 2019, First American Financial Corp. had 885 million records exposed online including bank transactions, social security numbers, and more.</p>



<p>Data about an individual’s financial transaction like the positions held in stocks and funds, outstanding debts, amount of assets, and purchases is usually sensitive. The person concerned could be the victim of identity theft or fraud if the criminals get access to such information. Similarly, data about a person’s purchases can reveal a great lot of information like the medications used, places visited, contacts, activities, or habits. This data may also be used by the corporations for the purpose of targeting the individual concerned with marketing customized towards the personal preferences of those individuals which the person concerned may or may not approve.</p>



<h4><strong>Internet Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In the modern era, where most of the information is shared online be it on social networking sites or other Apps, people experience growing concern about privacy challenges. With the use of various search engines and data mining, it has become possible to collect and combine information from a wide variety of sources very easily.</p>



<p><strong>For instance the Aadhaar Data Breach:</strong></p>



<p> In 2018 there was a massive breach In India allowing access to private information of Aadhaar holders, exposing their names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and their bank details along with the photographs, thumbprints, retina scans, and other identifying details of nearly 1.1 billion citizens.</p>



<p>One of the most worrisome issues of today’s world is the ability of a third person to control the information one reveals over the internet and who can access that information, whether Email can be read or stored by third parties without consent if websites one visited can collect, store and possibly share the personal information, whether third parties can track the websites that someone visited, etc.</p>



<h4><strong>Locational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Locational Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Locational data is the most sensitive data being collected by tracking capabilities of mobile devices which have the potential to strip away locational privacy from individuals, making it possible to intrude into the lives of others by consulting location databases. In 2017, McDelivery leak disclosed home addresses and even exact coordinates of 2.2 million users.</p>



<p>By tracking the locational information, potentially sensitive professional and personal information like the presence of a person at an abortion clinic, an AIDS counselor, attendance of a religious place, etc. could be exposed which unfortunately poses a threat to locational privacy.</p>



<h4><strong>Medical Privacy</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Depicting Medical Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Confidentiality and privacy are essential to all trusting relationships such as that between a doctor and a patient. Patient confidentiality and protection of privacy have always been the basis of the doctor-patient relationship. People usually do not prefer that their medical records be revealed to others because of the fact that it may affect their medical insurance, employment, and that it may bring embarrassment upon them.</p>



<p>Medical privacy may include information relating to physical and sexual activity, genetic data, bodily functions, psychological problems, etc.</p>



<p>In 2018, the healthcare sector saw 15 million patient records compromised in 503 breaches, three times the amount seen in the previous year, according to the Protenus Breach Barometer.</p>



<h4><strong>Educational Privacy</strong></h4>



<p>In earlier days, photocopies, textbooks, and filmstrips supplied the entire educational content to the students. However, with the advancement of technology and telecommunications, the education system has greatly changed and a new system including personalized content, virtual forms of interaction, and interactive technologies has been introduced.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though the adopters of these technologies have proved their worth by transforming the educational process however, the use of high-tech education systems has proved to be a double-edged sword. Using information systems like Arcon and portal, tools like Microsoft Office and Google, educational Apps like Edmodo and Dropbox exposes the student data to a number of security and privacy risks. Technologies like information sharing, telecommunication innovations, and web-hosting also expose the information related to students to risks during their use.</p>



<p>In 2020, cybersecurity firm Cybele discovered at least 530,000 zoom accounts listed for sale on a dark web hacker forum for $0.0020 cents.</p>



<p>The data relating to students so exposed or improperly disclosed can cause significant harm to students where students may indulge in violating each other’s privacy like online gossip, cyberbullying, etc. Besides, it can also result in a misunderstanding between schools and parents, alumni, applicants, and others.</p>



<h4><strong>Data Privacy Risks</strong></h4>



<p>As personal information has become the subject of a digitized world, the risks of cyber attacks have increasingly posed a threat to data privacy. The data privacy risks have the tendency to cause a data breach when a cybercriminal infiltrates a data source and extracts confidential information. While most data breaches occur due to hacking or malware attacks other methods include accidental data sharing, employee data theft, internet fraud, etc.</p>



<p><strong>The most common data breaches occur due to the following risks:</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Accidental Data Sharing&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Personal data is usually exposed by cybercriminals however, sometimes the company’s own employees accidentally share and misplace consumer’s sensitive data resulting in the data breach. For example in 2018, hundreds of Australian’s personally identifiable information and health information we&#8217;re exposed to the public after an employee accidentally shared some sensitive data with an organizational outsider.</p>



<p><strong>• Employee Data Theft</strong></p>



<p>The data theft by a departing employee is a bigger threat than that of a hacker. It occurs most frequently when an employee leaves or resigns from an organization to work for a competitor or to set up their own rival company. For instance, Levandowski in 2019, stole diagrams and drawings related to simulations, radar technology, and Light Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), source code snippets, PDFs marked as confidential, Videos of test drives, and Marketing information from Google and provided it to Uber.</p>



<p><strong>Most commonly the data theft includes stealing of customer information, financial records, Email list, process document, employees records etc.</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;• Ransomware</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ransomware attacks have been becoming grave as the years pass by. Ransomware is the form of malware that encrypts the victim’s file. The attacker then demands the victim to restore access to data upon payment. In order to retrieve the basic data hostage and to restore affected data, most of the organizations agree to pay the ransom to the attackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;As witnessed in 2019, the ransomware attacks have vastly affected sectors like health care, manufacturing, finance, etc. As a response to this many companies has put forth ransomware prevention as a priority in 2020.</p>



<p><strong>• Bad Password Hygiene&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Account passwords should be such so that they are difficult to guess and harder to crack. An overwhelming number of passwords may lead to poor password hygiene when there is no technology in place to help.</p>



<p>Reusing and sharing of passwords has remained a common practice in most businesses among the employees resulting in countless data breaches and individual account takeovers.</p>



<p>The incidents leading to poor password hygiene may include selecting passwords that are obvious, selecting the same password for each account, temptation to share passwords with others for convenience, and writing down the passwords for easy recall, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Phishing Emails&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A phishing attack is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon to lure the victim with an attempt to obtain sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It manipulates the victims into performing certain actions like clicking on a malicious link or willfully disclosing the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>• Internet Frauds&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The main aim of internet fraud usually is to deceive the victim or to otherwise take advantage of them by stealing the information. such information can be used for financial gain by making fraudulent transactions, draining bank accounts, etc. which may result in significant reputational repercussions and increase the risk of class action lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>one of the oldest internet fraud examples is Nigerian Email scams. Someone from a country (often Nigeria, but not always) contacts you via email in broken English. They explain that a rich person they know has died and the money has nowhere to go; if you can help them get the funds out of the country, they’ll give you some as a reward</p>



<p>The most prominent internet frauds are online shopping frauds, email scams, identity theft, tax scams, lottery frauds, matrimonial frauds, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Bribery&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bribery mostly results in serious data security concern to those companies whose data and intellectual property is incredible of high value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Though bribery not being the most convenient way to perpetuate data, however, the officials of a company can be bribed into revealing the company’s confidential data. In 2018, the employees of Amazon were accused of participating in a bribery scheme that compromises customer data, and a year later it was discovered that AT&amp;T employees received bribes to plant malware on the company’s network.</p>



<h4><strong>How important is Data Privacy?</strong></h4>



<p>Data is an incredibly important part of a company’s asset, collecting and sharing of data can be a big business in today’s digital world but for a business to safely and successfully take advantage of data they are collecting, they need to have safeguards in place to ensure that data is under tight lock and consumers are not subject to uninvited surveillance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this age of digital economy, true company value lies in the collected customer data which is an asset, worthy of being protected. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data created and stored continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Any information stored digitally needs to be properly protected right from financial information and payment details to contact information. Data protection is not only a legal necessity but crucial for protecting and maintaining the business also.</p>



<p>Data privacy importance lies in the fact that individuals are able to maintain their autonomy and individuality over how their personal information moves into the economy and society. The right to privacy is the fundamental right of an individual so he is at liberty to protect his data and regulate its use.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Data Privacy Tips</strong>:</p>



<p>While the new decade promised an unexplored revolution in the field of Information Technology which has blurred the lines between the real world and the virtual one, it becomes vital for people to be more concerned about their privacy. </p>



<p><strong>Some tips that may help to create a friendly environment for commerce, learning, and communication are listed as follows;</strong></p>



<p><strong>• Use a Safe Search Engine</strong></p>



<p>It’s possible that sometimes a person can be scammed easily by fake engines leading one to fake pages that look like true intended sites. So if one intends to search an online retailer, instead of searching him through the search engine, one should directly visit the secure https:// page or use the App launched by such retailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>•<strong> Use Two Factor Authentication</strong></p>



<p>Two-factor authentication is a higher level of security process than the single factor authentication method in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. It adds an extra layer of security by making the logins extra secure and difficult for hackers to hack sensitive information. It confirms the identity of a person by using two factors one is the password and the other is the security token or a biometric factor, such as fingerprint or facial scan.</p>



<p>• <strong>Anti-Virus Software&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The updated Anti-virus software program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware can better protect sensitive data from being hacked. It not only safeguards from malicious files and viruses but also helps to protect personal information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Digital Vault</strong></p>



<p>Digital Vault is an online vault that protects the information inside it by securing the data from all major risks over the network. It provides great help in securing all the necessary information like a credit card, social security, driving license, passport numbers, etc.</p>



<p>•<strong> Use a Safe Wi-Fi Environment</strong></p>



<p>The public wifi is inherently less secure than that of the personal one because the number of connections is not known. One should always avail of the safest security protocol to avoid data theft or privacy issues while on public wifi. For this purpose, one can use a secure VPN that hides the IP address and encrypts the information over the web.</p>



<p>• <strong>Limited Information on Social Media</strong></p>



<p>For the protection of personal data, one should avoid personally identifiable information to be shared on social networking sites which could be later used as answers to security questions. The social media privacy settings should be updated to limit the information collected by different sites and who can see the information.</p>



<p>•<strong> Strong Passwords</strong></p>



<p>One should always create strong passwords by making use of capital letters, lowercase, numbers, special characters and change them often. The stronger the password, the more difficult a threat will be.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>How much are&nbsp;the Countries Concerned?</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1IP5XARUhpT-d-CjaXxDGVOB3hs1R1cuuMRuKqU7L_SCvYVdZ0daDj1IRFkOUcmAeUTB-lu3qY7B0MkFErI5Q17-pVrXWMLy9CMMoAky0bgpDf7FgM_VnstJgF7qFdFYI8umBXM6" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In order to address the data privacy issues like data theft, phishing email attacks, ransomware attacks, etc. almost every country around the Globe has enacted data privacy legislation under their municipal laws. These laws govern the rules and regulations for the collection, storage, and use of collected data in a legitimate manner. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the privacy laws around the world are as follows:</strong></p>



<p>1. <strong>CCPA</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act / USA&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Officially in effect on January 1st, 2020, this legislation demands the companies to inform the user of data processing, take extra measures to protect user information, and allow users a say in what data is collected and how it is shared.</p>



<p><strong>2. CALOPPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The California Online Privacy Protection Act/ USA.</strong></p>



<p>This Act requires commercial websites to post privacy policies detailing data collection and use on their website.</p>



<p><strong>3. CFAA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act/US.</strong></p>



<p>The law prohibits accessing the computer without authorization or excess of authorization in order to reduce the instances of malicious hacking.</p>



<p><strong>4. PIPEDA</strong></p>



<p><strong>The personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act/Canada.</strong></p>



<p>This Act mandates that businesses using data for, or in the course of, commercial activities, must disclose the purpose of that data collection to the owners of that data, and obtain consent to proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>5. LGPD</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lei Geral de Protèçao de dados Pessoais/ Brazil.</strong></p>



<p>LGPD is landmark legislation outlining data processing standards, including the ten legal bases on which the data can be processed. While the law was modeled after the EU GDPR it is notably less strict.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>PDP</strong></p>



<p><strong>National Directorate of Personal Data Protection/ Argentina.</strong></p>



<p>This law replaced Argentina’s Personal Data Protection Law and it gave users for the first time in Argentina the right to request, the deletion, and transfer of data.</p>



<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>GDPR</strong></p>



<p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation/EU.</strong></p>



<p>It sets the strictest and most far-reaching standards for the handling of user data. It is based on the principles of consent, transparency, protection, and user control, and threatens fines as high as 4% of a company&#8217;s annual revenue.</p>



<p><strong>8. e-Privacy</strong></p>



<p><strong>e-Privacy Directive and Regulation/ EU.</strong></p>



<p>The ePrivacy Directive is often referred to as cookie law due to its requirement that websites obtain user consent to non-essential cookies before launching those cookies.</p>



<p><strong>9. BBSG</strong></p>



<p><strong>Budesdatenschupzgesetz/Germany.</strong></p>



<p>This Law sets rigid standards under which businesses are required to adopt and maintain protective measures for data stored in IT systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>10. POPI</strong></p>



<p><strong>Protection Of Personal Information Act/South Africa.</strong></p>



<p>This Law applies to all South African organizations. It sets a standard of accountability for responsible data processing and establishes the requirement of customer consent to direct marketing outreach.</p>



<p><strong>11. Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018(India).</strong></p>



<p>After the Right to Privacy was determined as a Fundamental Human Right in 2017. India’s first Data Privacy Law was quickly created. The legislation sets privacy and data protection standards and notably introduces mandatory annual data audits.</p>



<p><strong>12. Cyber Security Law (china).</strong></p>



<p>China’s was enacted to increase data protection, data localization, and cybersecurity in the interest of national security.</p>



<p><strong>13. ECPA</strong></p>



<p><strong>Electronic Communications Privacy Act/ US.</strong></p>



<p>It prohibits the third party from disclosing private electronic communication without authorization.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Data privacy has generated the attention of the individuals, sharing sensitive personally identifiable information due to the privacy breach incidents which are increasing as the technology is evolving. The collection, transfer, and dissemination of information which usually takes place via the internet, get exposed to a number of risks. For this reason, it generates the attention of the public, academics, government, and the business class which is valuable for the reason that would encourage concern to be shown to the past and future of privacy protection.</p>



<p>Privacy being a fundamental right is an element of a healthy democratic society and a social property which relates to power, culture, values, social standing, liberty, and dignity among other things.</p>



<p>In order to take the account of data privacy risks, though much legislation has been enacted to address these issues, however, there are still incidents of data privacy intrusions for which the countries need to come up with the effective implementation of those legislations. Since there is an alarming rise of data privacy risks leading to data thefts and data breaches, the Legislations alone won’t count so, it’s high time that the information technology industry and government come together to lay down and regulate the effective means and norms to curb the menace of intrusion of privacy.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Road accidents are the most unwanted common thing nowadays. As the number of people buying automobiles is increasing, the number of road accidents is also increasing. Motorization although has eased life in many aspects, but it has come with a price. Road accidents claim over a million precious lives every year across the globe. World Health Organization (WHO) reports providing those road accidents are one of the leading causes of death, among other reasons. Road accidents are basically an outcome of an interplay among different factors that comprise the vehicle, environment, and the human being. India, which is a vigorously developing country, has its issues relating to road accidents due to the rapid expansion of motorization.&nbsp; Traditionally, road accidents are looked at as unpredictable, inevitable, and not preventable. However, road accidents are predictable and preventable in most cases. The only requirement is adherence to traffic rules and specific other precautionary and preventive measures. The adoption of preventive steps would help in decreasing the mortality rate due to road accidents.</p>



<h4>Contributing Causes of Road Accidents in India</h4>



<p>Road accidents mainly occur due to reckless and over-speed driving, not following basic traffic rules, overhauling, and poor maintenance of the vehicles. Below mentioned are some common driving errors which cause most road accidents.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Human Activities</strong></h4>



<h4>1.1 <strong>O</strong>ver Speeding:</h4>



<p>&nbsp;Almost 64% of road deaths are caused by over speeding. According to data collected by Save Life Foundation, almost 60% of the accidents in India occur on highways, mostly because of speeding. The most deaths due to speeding were in Rajasthan (9,618 deaths), followed by Tamil Nadu (9,224 deaths) and Karnataka (8,714 deaths). The current speed limit in the country is 80 km per hour on a 4-lane highway. However, the WHO has recommended that if we reduce the speed limit to about 55-57 km per hour, we could save around 30%-37% lives.</p>



<h4><strong>1.2 Drunk Driving:</strong></h4>



<p> Drunk driving is the other leading cause of road fatalities. Drunk driving is a serious offense and as per rules laid down by the court, any driver found with more than 30 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood is under the influence of alcohol and is a culprit of drunk driving. &nbsp; According to National Crime Records Bureau’s report on Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2015, about 1.5 percent of all the total 4.64 lakh road accidents were caused by drunk driving, resulting in injuries to 6,295 people. However in 2017 and 2018 accidents under the influence of alcohol or drugs has declined by 14% because of an increase in fines and better implementation of laws,</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>1.3&nbsp; Driving License</strong>:</h4>



<p>&nbsp;The statistics provided by a report released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways on ‘Road Accidents in India, 2018’ was shocking it shows that about 74% of road accidents involved drivers holding a valid driver’s license and 26% of road accidents are caused by drivers who did not have a valid license or were driving with a learner’s license, which clearly indicates that license is not signed that driver is qualified. For example, if we ask a driver about any basic rule of the road, like blind spots in their vehicle while driving almost 99% will not be aware.</p>



<h4><strong>1.4 </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Avoiding Safety Gears like seat Belts and Helmets:</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;As many as 48,746 people were killed riding two-wheelers in road accidents in 2017, of which 74% or 35,975 were not wearing a helmet. Likewise, 26,896 people killed in road accidents did not fasten seat belts&#8211;these included drivers as well as passengers.“Safety devices such as helmets and seatbelts do not prevent accidents but are critical for averting fatal and grievous injuries in an event of road accidents,” the road accidents 2017 report said. “Correct helmet use” can reduce the risk of fatal injuries by 42% and risk of head injuries by 69%, the World Health Organization’s Global Status Report On Road Safety 2018, said. “Wearing a seat-belt reduces the risk of death among drivers and front-seat occupants by 45-50% and the risk of death and serious injuries among rear seat occupants by 25%.”</p>



<h4><strong>2. R</strong>oad Environment </h4>



<p>The causes related to the category of road environment include (i) accidents happening in a particular geographical area (residential, commercial institutional, etc), (ii) those related to the type of road features including straight, curved, steep, etc, (iii) type of junction &amp; type of traffic control, (iv) weather condition, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Present Scenario in India</h4>



<p>Taking road safety as a serious issue, in 2015, India signed the Brasilia declaration and committed to reducing road accidents and fatalities by half. So far, the fall in road accidents has not been so satisfactory. In 2017, road accidents in India decreased by merely 3.27% with 4, 64,910 road crashes as against 4, 80,652 in 2016. Fatalities resulting from these accidents were an even smaller drop &#8212; just 1.9%. As many as 147,913 individuals have died in road crashes in 2017 against 1, 50,785 in 2016. This not so encouraging data is further marred by road fatal figures of the first quarter of 2018 which shows a 1.68% rise over the corresponding quarter. Road accident severity measured by the number of persons killed per 100 accidents, has seen an increase of 0.6 percentage points in 2018 over the previous year. India ranks 1st in the number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and the US. As per the WHO Global Report on Road Safety 2018, India accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the World.</p>



<h4>Policy Making And Policy Implementation Regarding Road Accidents In India</h4>



<h4>Position of Law in India</h4>



<p>India has the world&#8217;s second-largest road network and it accounts for 10% of the fatalities caused by road accidents worldwide. The laws which regulate the traffic on the road are provided under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The law gives in detail all the legislative policies and provisions with regard to licensing of drivers, registration of motor vehicles, state transport undertakings, traffic regulation, liability, insurance, offenses, and penalties, etc. The compliance of traffic-related regulations is enforced by concerned agencies which include Traffic police. The parliament of India has recently made an amendment to the Motor Vehicles act, 1988 to control traffic-related issues and to place stringent punishment for violators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Some of important traffic laws under the said Act are:</strong></p>



<ol><li>If a person is found driving with more than 30 mg of alcohol in 100ml of his blood, the police have the power to arrest that person without any warrant. Imprisonment for drunken driving may extend up to 06 months and/or fine up to Rs. 10,000 for first-time offenders and imprisonment may extend up to 02 years and/or Rs. 15,000 for second-time offenders. This provision is made to contain drunken driving which is a major cause of road accidents.</li><li>Two-wheeler riders are required to wear helmets and the maximum limit for riders is two on bikes etc.</li><li>If any person/s is found racing and speeding, the police have powers to arrest and imprisonment may extend for one-month and/or fine up to Rs 500 for first-time offenders, and for second offenders, imprisonment may extend up to one- month and/or fine up to Rs 10,000.</li><li>If a person is found driving despite being disqualified from driving, the said person would attract a penalty up to Rs. 10,000.</li><li>If a person is found driving an uninsured vehicle, he/she may be punished with imprisonment and/or with a fine.</li></ol>



<h4>Policy Implementation in India</h4>



<p>The Government and the concerned agencies are putting their best to stop the fatalities which are caused due to road accidents. However, India has one of the worst road-safety records in the world. As per data from Road Accidents in India 2018, over the last decade, more than a million people who are mostly aged between 15 &#8211; 45 years, have lost their lives on the roads.</p>



<p>The major reason for this failure remains poor enforcement. India has stricter Traffic laws than other countries but unfortunately, these laws are not enforced properly.</p>



<p><strong>Some of the critical issues which need to be resolved to make roads of India less accident-prone:</strong></p>



<ol><li>The amendments made in Motor Vehicles law in force are relevant to metro cities only. Its enforcement in the whole of India is irrelevant without an upgrade to the infrastructure of roads which includes road widening, removal of encroachments from sidewalks, and bazaars from main roads. First, a conducive environment for driving needs to be set up, only then heavy fines could be imposed on errant drivers.</li><li>It is the national highways that remain the area of concern where 30% of accidents and 36% of deaths take place. These fatal road accidents are majorly attributed to faulty layout or construction defects which include erroneous road designs, sharp curves, slippery surface, poor illumination, etc. Therefore the National Highway Authority of India would have to invest more so that the faults are corrected right away and road accidents are contained.</li><li>In rural India, road accidents deaths mainly occur due to driving without helmets, trucks, motorcycles, and tractors without proper lights; incautious construction of speed-breakers, and roadside Dhabas encroachments.</li><li>There lacks proper driving education and training among the general masses. Road safety education needs to be imparted to improve the behavioral factor of people which leads to accidents. Road safety programs need to be held at schools, colleges, etc.</li><li>India has a poor ratio of traffic police to the number of motor vehicles present across the country. This makes the task of traffic control and management very difficult.</li></ol>



<h4>Road Safety Measures In Low-Income Countries(LMC&#8217;s)</h4>



<p>The safety of road users is a global health issue because large proportions of unintentional injuries are caused by traffic-related crashes. According to the Global Health Observatory, 1.35 million fatalities occur on the world’s roads each year. This problem becomes even more critical in low-income countries (LICs), due to several faults in road safety standards, vehicle safety and maintenance, and in the design and implementation of policies and safe transportation infrastructure. With the aim of reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities and guide road safety policies and strategies, several steps at a global level are taken, many of which are coordinated through the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 developed by the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC) . Efforts at the global level have generally focused on the practical implementation of policies and standards to improve road safety in the developing world. There is no single remedy to make roads safer in low- to middle-income nations; the problem must be tackled using a mixture of new safety technologies and well-established approaches.</p>



<p>Government investment in road safety management, enforcement, and post-crash response is insufficient in many developing countries. This marks a stark contrast to the United States where, in the past 50 years, government-regulated adoption of improved vehicle safety technologies, including seat belts, airbags, and electronic stability control is thought to have saved more than 600,000 lives. While improving the quality of roads and post-crash care will help, the implementation of basic safety standards and legislation is a crucial first step in saving lives. For example, in 2014, the Asia Injury Prevention Foundation presented a study to the Cambodian government which stated that 561 lives could be saved, 10,572 head injuries prevented, and USD $98 million saved by 2020 if legislators made motorcycle helmets mandatory. Road users, governments, and businesses must work together to make progress on road safety in the developing world, and ultimately reduce the number of crashes that occur.</p>



<h4>Suggestive Steps To Avoid Road Accidents:</h4>



<p>To reduce road accidents Three E (Education, Enforcement, and Engineering) formulas must be followed.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Education:</strong></h4>



<p><strong> </strong>Educating the populace, and children in particular, about road safety and good road user behavior, can help to reduce the number and severity of crashes. Communities and families have a considerable potential to influence the young and road safety programs to need to be developed in support of formal school programs. Also, the drivers should be given training about road safety, in the modern world social media has great control over the life of people, a campaign can also be started on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram to educate people about road safety measures.</p>



<h4><strong>2. Enforcement:</strong> </h4>



<p> Improving road safety through enforcement of legislation can also help promote road safety. Just like speed limits, there are many other traffic rules which must be followed to avoid road accidents like, traffic signals- taking cognizance and observing them, parking control measures, following one-way traffic regulations, including strictness in issuing a driving license for a different purpose, strictly check on drivers, vehicle condition, patrolling of law enforcing persons, an annual check of vehicle condition before the renewal of vehicle license.</p>



<h4><strong>3. Engineering</strong>:</h4>



<p> Engineers who implement careful access management can improve roadway safety for all vehicles while also promoting pedestrian safety and increased access for cyclists.&nbsp; Designing of road surfaces to reduce slip and increase friction, selection of safe design speed, which means design for slow speed where pedestrians are more likely to survive being hit by a car than die, channelization (particularly at intersections), the width of shoulders, parking, curves, traffic control devices, minimize the number of entries/exits.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Roads are the largest sources of interconnectivity. They are the vital sources of providing social, financial, health, and tourism connectivity. However, if safety measures are not taken up, roads can lead an individual to fatal consequences. It may not be possible to avoid all the road accidents which no country in the world has achieved yet. However, it is possible to minimize them by discharging our responsibilities as road users. Lost money can be earned, outdated vehicles can be replaced, and torn roads can be repaired, but human lives lost can never be replaced. Hence let us all learn to use roads responsibly and enable other road users to become participants in safe road initiatives. However, there is also a dire need for compliance with the stricter traffic laws. There is a need to understand the fact that we have not jumped on the road to enter a race, overtaking from the wrong side, etc. we could reach our destination even without rash driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>&nbsp;The means of production are owned and controlled by private businesses and the government has no role to play in production or prices. It is also known as a free market economy or free enterprise economy. This economic system is dominant in the Western world, mainly.</p>



<h4><strong>Origin of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy is one of the oldest economic systems in the world which emerged during the 17th century. Capitalist Economy arose from a systematic breakdown of feudalism as a social and economic system and the imposition of a wage-labor system in its place. It first started with merchants who were a link between customer and producer. However, they gradually dominated the latter by placing orders and paying in advance. Then became more powerful by supplying them raw material and paying wages for finished production. The Merchant then made the transition to capitalism by making profits from the ownership and control of means of production. As time passed by, mercantilism gradually evolved into the economic practices that would eventually be called Capitalism. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The Capitalist Economy is the most predominant in the current global economy. The USA, UK, Germany, Japan, Singapore, etc. are the classical examples of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Characteristics of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, private individuals and/or businesses own the capital good, that is, production. The production of goods and services is wholly based on the supply and demand in the market. The private individuals are unrestrained and without any interference from the side of government. They decide on their own as to where to invest the capital, what and how to produce, where and what to sell, and at which prices to exchange the goods and services.</p>



<p>Some of the chief characteristics of a Capitalist Economy could be summarized as:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Economic Freedom:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economic system, every individual is free to make economic choices without any intervention by the government. This freedom applies to both producers and consumers. Producers are free to produce any goods or services as per demand in the market. Similarly, consumers are free to buy the things they desire. Also, the workers are free to take employment wherever they desire and investors are free to invest wherever they get higher profit.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Profit Motive:</strong></h4>



<p>The driving force behind a capitalist economy is the profit motive. Business establishments exist to make a profit. The motive for the production and sale of goods and services is to gain profits and not just to solely satisfy the people&#8217;s needs and desires. The profit motive is responsible for the distribution of resources, determination of the character of the business, and leads to variations in production due to improved and increased technology.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Minimal Government Intervention:</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;Capitalist economic systems are characterized by minimal intervention by the government. Producers and consumers are at liberty to produce and buy goods and services respectively. Government intervention is limited to the protection of private property and the provision of public goods.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Consumer`s Sovereignty:</strong></h4>



<p>In a capitalist economy, a consumer is considered as a king. The whole production frameworks as per the directions of consumers. Utilization of resources, the technique of production, and the output, everything<strong> </strong>depends on impersonal force consumer&#8217;s demand. The consumers are at liberty to buy any goods and services as they need and desire. The choice of consumers is not subject to any restraint.</p>



<h4><strong>5. A Two-Class System:</strong></h4>



<p>Under the capitalist economic system, society is divided into two groups of individuals: The capitalist class and the Workers class.</p>



<p>The capitalist class owns the means of production and distribution and purchase the labor power of others. The capitalist class regulates the whole production and distribution process.&nbsp; While the workers class does not own any means of production. They sell their labor to the capitalist class in exchange for wages. However, there exists conflict between the two over the issues of wage payement, working hours, and working conditions. The worker&#8217;s class always remains subordinate to the capitalist class.</p>



<h4><strong>6. Willingness to Change:</strong></h4>



<p>Another character of a capitalist economy is its ability to adapt and change. It allows the change and adaptability of newer tastes of society. It does not stick to a single trend; it changes with the change in society to satisfy the demands of consumers. It also focuses on overcoming inefficiencies within its economic structure.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Advantages of Capitalist Economy</strong></h4>



<p>In the Capitalist economic system, goods or services are distributed based on mechanisms set by societies, instead of government controls or mandates. The primary advantage of a Capitalist economy is that every individual has some sort of control over their fortune in life. The main benefit of the Capitalist economic system is that it provides strong incentives and motivation to grow, produce, innovate, improve, and move forward constructively. Some of the advantages of the capitalist economy are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>It  leads to innovation<em>:</em></strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy does create conditions for innovations to grow and thrive very quickly, for economic infrastructure to be built with maximum speed, making possible rapid development. &nbsp;Business owners invest in development and research to create better products. To get more profit every producer takes the new initiative to develop new techniques in production. The best example of innovation is the changing shapes and features of cellular mobile phones from hand handled mobile phones to pocket-size cellular phones.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>It is key to success:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Every person residing in a society focused on Capitalist economic systems does have an initial chance to find out success in many ways. Some may work even harder than others as everyone is surely going to get an opportunity at some level. There is one golden principle that if you work hard in your life, you have somehow a chance of reaching your definition of success.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>It  promotes participation:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy encourages people to get involved in all possible aspects of society to create the best outcome for themselves. People quickly get involved with different business activities so that they can get more and more benefits and create more capital.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Capitalist Economy embraces skills:</strong></h4>



<p>There are people with tremendous skills in this world that are not adequately utilized. A capitalist economy allows businesses to tap into these resources so that they can innovate. These innovations also create improving chances to continue for this developing world. This will undoubtedly bring an end to hunger, water scarcity, and other potentially life-threatening conditions.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>It leads to Economic Growth:</strong></h4>



<p>With the business firms and individuals facing incentives to be innovative, this creates a climate of innovation and therefore economic expansion. This in turn helps in an increase in real GDP and leads to improved living standards. In a capitalist economy, economic growth is faster and higher because the investor or the producer invests in the projects that are profitable to him. From a global perspective, before the industrial revolution, almost 80% of the world&#8217;s population lived in poverty. By 1980 that number had fallen to 34.8% and by 2000, less than 20% of the population lives on less than $1 a day. In the average country that became more capitalist over the last 25 years, the average citizen gained a 43% increase in income.</p>



<h4><strong>Disadvantages of Capitalist Economic System</strong></h4>



<p>Despite various merits and advantages of the capitalist economy, there are certain demerits of it. Some of which are:</p>



<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>More emphasis on the needs of business and not on the needs of the individual:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In a capitalist economy emphasis is more laid on the needs of the business rather than the needs of individuals. If companies want to remain operational, then they must introduce innovation in goods or services they offer and should also try to reduce costs. In a capitalist economy, there can be a misallocation of resources which results in higher production of luxury goods, which in turn will make the necessary goods more expensive and out of reach of an individual. Taking an example of some businesses (Telecom or IT or Pharmaceutical Companies, etc.) these are growing in this pandemic also but the common man is still striving for essentials.</p>



<h4><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Less government interference:</strong></h4>



<p>In a strong capitalist economic society, there is less or no interference of government and due to this the resources available are being utilized by few individuals to create opportunities and it leads to consolidation.</p>



<h4><strong>3.</strong> <strong>People with disabilities are neglected:</strong></h4>



<p>The main focus of the Capitalist economy is too non-disabled individuals. If someone is unable to be productive, no matter what either because of injury or disability, they no longer have the ability to contribute and such individuals are left behind.</p>



<h4><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Competition is dragged into market:</strong></h4>



<p>The capitalist economy only focuses on the best. This means that larger businesses with more capital workforce smaller companies that lie out of their niches. It also means that workers with superior skills are forced out to work that usually may have an average based skillset.</p>



<h4><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Not bothered about the environment and other social structure:</strong></h4>



<p>The primary goal of the Capitalist economy is based mainly on consumption, so almost all of the energy is spent on that particular purpose alone. There is no consideration given to the environmental and social structures of the society, and no responsibility is shown so whatever harm may be done in another area.</p>

<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years, the capitalist economy has evolved. Starting with Feudalism followed by mercantilism and then capitalism. The capitalist economy needs a free market to succeed. Distribution of goods in a capitalist economic system is done according to laws of supply and demand.&nbsp; In a capitalist economy, the best products are generated for the best prices because consumers will pay more for what they want the most. The essential reward of a capitalist economy is the innovation of new products and more efficient production methods. The essential feature of capitalism is the motive to make a profit. In a capitalist economy, there is rational self-interest that can lead to economic growth. However, like anything else, a capitalist economy has its disadvantages too. No doubt that the capitalist economy has surpassed economic growth more than that of other economic systems, but the concentration of wealth in the hands of few always remains controversial. The forces that lead to the success of a capitalist economy may also act as a reason for its failure; it is necessary to take appropriate measures to protect the free market from powerful private interests.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“A revolution is not a bed of roses. A revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>                                                 ~Fidel Castro</em></strong></p>



<h3><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>On a December day in 2010, <strong>Mohamed Bouazizi</strong>, a Tunisian street vendor, stood in front of a Government office and set himself on fire, killing himself. Bouazizi had been harassed by cops who attempted to shut down his business with no recourse, and his suicide by self-immolation galvanized Tunisian protesters. His actions helped spark a revolutionary uprising that has come to be known as the <strong>‘Arab Spring’</strong>. Protesters demonstrated against Government corruption and Tunisia’s autocratic president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. A month later, after 23 years in power, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This raised hopes among millions of other citizens within the neighboring Arab countries. Thus, within a short period, the protests spread to other countries like Algeria, Libya, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Yemen, and some other Gulf countries. The demands of the protesters varied from country to country but in general, it included demands for political freedom, social freedom, press freedom, improved human rights conditions, economic betterment, etc. The demands reflect a desire among the masses, particularly the new generation of young and educated, to be liberated from the reins of the old and authoritarian leadership and play a role in the decision-making process of the state. So far, the protests have overthrown four long-serving dictators — <strong>Ben Ali</strong> of <strong>Tunisia</strong>, <strong>Hosni Mubarak </strong>of <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Muammar Gaddafi</strong> of <strong>Libya</strong>, and <strong>Ali Abdullah Saleh</strong> of <strong>Yemen</strong>. While the Bashar Al Assad regime in Syria is struggling for its survival, other countries have successfully managed to suppress the protests against the regimes either by a crackdown or by promising economic and political reforms.</p>



<h4><strong>Why the name ‘Arab Spring’?</strong></h4>



<p>The name “Arab Spring” is a reference to the 1848 Revolution- also known as the “People’s spring” – when political upheavals swept Europe. Ever since the word “spring” has been used to describe movements towards democracy like Czechoslovakia’s 1968 “Prague Spring”. Western media started popularizing the term “Arab Spring” in 2011.</p>



<h4><strong>Who was Mohamed Bouazizi?</strong></h4>



<p>Mohamed Bouazizi was a Tunisian street vendor from the village of Sidi Salah. Bouazizi was three years old when his father died. In the village in his small room, he was educated with his six siblings. To provide basic needs and necessities to his family he left education in his early teens but always dreamt of completing high school. He was the sole earner of the family besides supporting his mother, uncle, younger siblings. He applied for the military but was rejected.</p>



<p>In December 2010, Bouazizi (who was now 26 years old) was getting ready to sell fruits and vegetables. He was stopped by police for not having the necessary permit to sell products. He was humiliated by Faida Hamdy, a female police officer who allegedly slapped him, confiscated his weighing scales, and pushed over his cart. He requested the return of scales to the Governor but was however rejected. Governor even refused to see him despite his threats that he would burn himself.</p>



<p>After his request was turned away, he marched to a Government building and set himself on fire. Before setting himself on fire, he shouted “how do you expect me to make a living”. Although people tried to save him, he was having 90% burn injuries on his body. The President of Tunisia came to see him in the hospital and promised that he will send him to France for treatment but no such transfer was arranged. After remaining 18 days in a comatose state he died in January 2011. Thousands attended his funeral and pledged to avenge his death.</p>



<h4><strong>Aftermath of Bouazizi’s Death</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Tunisia</strong></li></ul>



<p>After the self-immolation of Bouazizi, the Tunisians took to the streets and began demonstrating which was captured by cell phone cameras and shared on the internet. Western Media started popularizing it as ‘Arab Spring’. Within days, protests started popping up across the country, calling upon President Ben Ali and his regime to step down. A brutal security crackdown followed, reported in shocking details by online social media. When protests reached the capital, Tunis, the government responded with even more brutality, arresting demonstrators, activists, and shutting down the Internet. This act marked the end of one of the Arab world&#8217;s most repressive regimes. It was a victory for people power and perhaps the first time ever in history that an Arab dictator has been removed by a revolution instead of a coup d’état.</p>



<p>About a month later, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. A democratic free election was held to choose members of the council in which all the Tunisians participated. The members were given the task of drafting a new constitution and the democratically chosen Prime Minister and President took oath and office.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8g0IXXbkox_QyLQ8cHql5WPZ7lv_8QLwiv4FaAfs8pBz5vP6S_yfWL3guUmBkgMqccZJzS8D62LbVG3pd0LEVt_Ut1rXMH3v19s33nAQMeasBSKKzVCOc72_keI6jEREixPWaA" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\tunis.PNG"/></figure>



<p>Tunisians protest outside the gates of the French Embassy in Tunis. Arab Spring began in Tunisia when a fruit vendor set himself on fire in protest in front of a government building.</p>



<p>After Tunisia protests began to spread to other countries like Libya, Yemen, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Egypt</strong></li></ul>



<p>In late January of the same year (i.e. 2011), massive protests broke out in Egypt only after a few days of the ouster of Ben Ali’s in Tunisia. To control protests the Egyptian government started cracking down violently against the demonstrators. After several days of massive demonstrations and clashes between the security forces and protesters in Cairo and around the country, a turning point came when the Egyptian army announced that it would not use force against the protesters and started calling for the removal of President Hosni Mubarak. After military withdrawal support, the president left office after nearly 30 years, and the senior military officers ceded to the power.</p>

<p>A great role played by the military in ending the Mubarak regime has led the new military administration to enjoy high public approval. However, the new administration appeared hesitant to transfer full powers to an elected government and the use of force was resumed by military and security forces against the protesters. In late November 2011 despite this multiday outbreak of violence, the parliamentary elections were held and after a year People’s Assembly- a newly elected assembly held its inaugural session.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, the civil war began that lasted for several years, forcing many to leave Syria to seek refuge in Turkey, Greece, and throughout Western Europe. For a time, the militant group ISIS had declared a caliphate (a nation that is governed by Islamic Law) in northern Syria. This group has executed thousands of people there, and many others fled the region in fear of their lives.</p>



<p>Although the ISIS group has largely been defeated in Syria, yet the oppressive regime of long term dictator Bashar al Assad remains in power in the country. The infrastructure of the country has suffered significant damage, and the conflict has devolved into tribal warfare.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Libya</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Libya, Muammar Gaddafi (authoritarian dictator Colonel) was overthrown in 2011, during a violent civil war. He was tortured (literally dragged through the streets) and was executed by opposition fighters. However, since his downfall, Libya has remained in a state of civil war, and the two opposing governments rule separate regions of the country. During the years of political upheaval, the civilian population has suffered significantly, with violence in the streets and access to food, resources, and healthcare services severely limited.</p>

<p>This has contributed to the ongoing worldwide refugee crisis, which has seen thousands of Libyan fleeing the country, most often by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, with hopes of new opportunities in Europe.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Bahrain</strong></li></ul>



<p>The reforms in Tunisia and Egypt prompted the other countries to rise against the dictatorship, corruption, and other issues. In February 2011, Bahrain Human Rights activists and members of Bahrain marginalized Shiite majority protested and demanded political and economic reforms in Bahrain. The Bahrain security forces along with forces from Saudi Arabia and UAE violently suppressed the protestors. Dozens of accused protest leaders were imprisoned; hundreds of Shiite workers fired and Shiite mosques in dozens were demolished by the government&#8217;s aftermath protest. An independent investigation commissioned by the Bahraini government concluded that excessive force and torture has been used against the protesters by the government. The government assured us to act on the report in which recommendations for reformation were included.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Yemen</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Yemen, the first protest appeared in late January of 2011. President Ali Abd Allah Salih’s base of support was damaged when a number of the country’s most powerful tribal and military leaders aligned together with the pro-democracy protesters calling for him to step down. But they failed to remove Salih from power. In June, he was injured in a bomb attack and he left Yemen to receive medical treatment, raising hopes among the opposition that a transition would begin. Four months later when Salih returned to the country added to the uncertainty and confusion about Yemen’s political future. He signed an internationally mediated agreement in November of the same year in which he agreed for a phased transfer of power to the then-Vice President, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Accordingly, Hadi took over governing responsibility and formally assumed the Presidency after standing as the sole candidate in a presidential election in 2012.</p>

<p><em>Yemeni demonstrators calling for President ʿAlī ʿAbd Allah Ṣāliḥ to step down.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Social Media and Revolutions</strong></h4>



<p>Social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and mobile telephones played a major role in spreading information and serving as a mobilizing tool for the spontaneous and organic gathering of protesters during the Arab Spring across the MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) region in early 2011. Images of Tunisian protests against social and economic inequities and the regime’s oppression of people, which were widely shared on social media and through mobile telephone devices, inspired and created anti-government protesters in other countries in the region. Authoritarian regimes have often cut off access to the Internet to quell the protests; though they have failed to stop them.</p>



<p>Tweets, texts, videos, blogs, and Facebook pages became the most effective communication and mobilizing tools for young Arab demonstrators. Social media was key to shaping the political debate of the Arab Spring. Political discussions and calls for change happened not only inside Arab states but also across borders of the MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) region. Social media conversations of protesters in Tunisia and Egypt were continued in other countries. And thanks to the Internet, social media, and mobile phones, images, and conversations of protests quickly reached the world, erasing global information borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although digital technology has been a powerful tool for political and social mobilization, this tumultuous and chaotic decade in the Arab world showed that no real change will happen if repressive regimes are more bent on killing their citizens than making any compromise. If before 2011 the authoritarian governments in MENA have not fully understood how to use social media, by the end of the decade they have skillfully weaponized digital media to spread misinformation and propaganda to maintain control and smear and discredit dissidents, shut down the Internet when it suits them, and intimidate and jail online activists in hopes to curb dissent. Social media became a double-edged sword for forces seeking positive change and maintaining the status quo.</p>



<h4><strong>Impacts of Arab Spring</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Climate Change</strong></li></ul>



<p>MENA is one of the most vulnerable regions of the world to climate change. Shortages of freshwater, drought, desertification, extreme heat and dust storms have already shown the region’s climate trajectory during this decade. Climate change was a contributing factor to the Arab Spring. Crop failures, food shortages, and higher food prices worsened the living conditions of the masses, forcing many of them to move within and beyond the borders of their countries in pursuit of a better life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a study published in the Global Environmental Change journal, there was a strong connection between climate change and conflicts in MENA between 2010 and 2012. For example, severe droughts in Syria between 2006 and 2011 decimated agriculture and caused a major migration of farmers to cities. Competition over scarce resources worsened the living conditions of Syrians, who began demanding change from their government.</p>



<p>Subsequent protests against corruption, poverty, and the authoritarian rule of President Bashar al-Assad started one of the most brutal civil wars of the 21st century, which continues to this day. Over these years, power shortages under extreme heat have triggered mass unrest in Iraq and Egypt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instability and conflict in MENA will be closely tied to climate change in the coming years. German research organization, the Max Planck Institute, predicts that daytime temperatures may reach and stay at 50 degrees Celsius throughout each year in MENA by the end of the century. According to its findings, large areas of MENA may become unlivable by then, if global emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mass Migration</strong></li></ul>



<p>The most prominent feature of the past decade was the start of an enormous global refugee crisis. By the end of the decade, there were more refugees than after the end of World War II. The Syrian war created some of the worst refugees’ crisis in the world. Almost 6 million Syrians fled their country since 2011, and more than 6 million remain internally displaced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The largest number of refugees in Europe have come from Syria. However, despite the spike in the number of asylum seekers in Europe, the biggest burden of helping refugees has fallen in developing countries with weak economies and fragile social stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan received the highest numbers of refugees from Syria in proportion to their populations. Besides, Lebanon and Jordan host more than 2 million Palestinian refugees. Refugees continue to put stress on the social and economic stability of these three countries. More developed and rich Arabian Gulf countries could do more to help refugees in and from MENA than they have done so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sectarian Divisions</strong></li></ul>



<p>One of the most defining events in MENA this decade was the deepening Sunni-Shia schism, intensified by ideological competition between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. During this period, Saudi Arabia, which sees itself as the leader of Sunni Muslims, has stepped up its efforts to contain the growing influence of Iran in MENA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The competition between these two countries over spheres of influence has exacerbated regional hostilities. Saudi Arabia and Iran turned the civil conflicts in Syria and Yemen into protracted bloody proxy wars with no end in sight. Iran’s disproportionate influence on Iraq and the powerful Shiite militia group Hezbollah in Lebanon has also inflamed internal tensions in these countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/qatar-blockade-gulf-crisis-190604220901644.html">cut diplomatic and commercial ties</a>&nbsp;with Qatar in 2017 and imposed a complete blockade on it for its alleged close ties with Iran and for “support of terrorism.” The blockade is still in place. Partly because of these events, Qatar withdrew from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2019, after a sixty-year membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being the world’s major exporters of oil and gas and members of OPEC, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also clashed over the direction of OPEC’s energy policy. Iran often opposed Saudi Arabia-dominated OPEC oil prices and the decision to coordinate prices with non-OPEC countries, such as Russia, which now commands a major influence on the oil cartel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia and Iran continue their bitter regional rivalry through proxy wars, exchange accusations about attacks on strategic objects – such as oil tankers and oil facilities, and supply arms to various militia groups in the region, they have avoided having a direct confrontation so far. With no signs of abating, the Saudi-Iranian cold war is likely to exacerbate the sectarian divisions in MENA for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The Arab Spring protests started in the Middle East because of the repression of people and their rights, the insistence of regimes on a monopoly of power and refusal of regimes to accept the transition power principle through elections, as well as poverty, corruption, unemployment, and marginalization of ethnic and youth groups. Arab dictatorships disgraced their own people and their arrogance went far enough. They used to pass reign by inheritance to their sons. They exploited the resources of the countries and shared it between their family members, friends, and relatives while the common people left in underdevelopment and poverty.</p>



<p>The power of peaceful protests and mass demonstrations through uprisings and the ability of social media had fuelled the protests and communicated its goals to the world. The uproar, turmoil, and tumult of the Arab Spring have shown the rest of the world that millions of people in Islamic nations believe in democratic government and free expression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben Ali ruled Tunisia for 20 years, Mubarak reigned in Egypt for 30 years, and Gaddafi held Libya in a tight grip for 40 years. Yet their bravest challengers were 20-30 years old without ideological baggage, violent intentions, or clear leadership. The groups that initiated and sustained protests had few meaningful experiences with public deliberation or voting and little experience with successful protests. However, these young activists were politically disciplined, pragmatic, and collaborative.</p>



<p>The revolution that started in Tunisia spread strongly to five countries. Now against the government, the citizens have the freedom to speak without any reprisal and democratic elections are taking place. The protests, demonstrations, uprisings try to put an end to the repression of free speech, and economic mismanagement, human rights abuses, and corruption.</p>



<p>The Dictators in Yemen, Libya, and Syria launched a war against their own people. No one can predict what will happen as the war is still on in Syria but one thing is clear that the people have come out in massive protest and have broken the barrier of fear. The protestors started peaceful protests however rulers confronted it by massive and excessive force and violence. Libya, Yemen, and Egypt have proven that it will not be an easy task to say where these revolutions are heading.</p>



<p>The revolutions of the Arab Spring are inspiring revolutions worldwide. The failure of the West system and the double standard policy of the West have encouraged the Arabs to adopt the modern pragmatic Islamic approach and discourage the adoption of western values. The game of the west replacing the dictators of the past with the new ones will not survive for long. And finally the masses, the young generation have promised and learned lessons and they will not give up until they achieve their all the basic and human rights.</p>



<p>This has brought the region a novel contour – a wave of protests for democratic reforms in an otherwise authoritarian Arab world. The regime change also carries with it the potentials of change in policies towards the neighborhood and beyond. Throughout the uprisings, the major regional countries have fought political and diplomatic wars among themselves aiming to assert their influence over the region. The outside powers have taken the opportunity to strengthen their interests by intervening in the conflicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the prospect of democracy within the region has receded. Most regimes have been able to keep at bay, at least for the time being, the calls for change. The expectations of the movement turned out to be overambitious. Arab spring is now commonly referred to as Arab winter (reflecting the failure of protest movements to bring about change within the region). Democracy may not have come fully to these countries as expected, yet the region has nevertheless changed dramatically in the last three years. The regimes have survived, but there is no surety of how long they will survive. The internal and external environment has changed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>&nbsp;Education is one of the most important things in man’s life. It shapes the character of an individual and makes him able to distinguish between right and wrong. Education promotes individual freedom and dignity and provides for all-round personality. With education, a person discovers himself/herself in a place where he /she can look outside all around the world. A well-educated man is a more dependable worker, a better citizen, a center of wholesome influence, pride to his community, and honor to his country. The right to education is distinguished as a human right. The right to education is an inherent right. This right is to eliminate discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards of education, and to provide quality education. The Right to Education Act lays down responsibilities on the Centre, State, and local authorities for its proper implementation. India, as a nation is actively making various provisions for practical education to the children and youth across the country.</p>



<h4>Origin of Right to Education in India:</h4>



<p>The right to education in India has a vast history. Before independence, the education sector of India remained under the British rulers who did not do much for its development. At the end of the British rule literacy rate of India was 12%. India attained independence in 1947 and to bring a newly independent country in parallel to other developed nations, there was a lot of debate among the members of the constituent assembly. The constituent committee first proposed to include the right to Primary Education in Part III (Fundamental Rights) of the constitution, however, the advisory committee later rejected the proposal. It was then placed in the category of Directive Principles of State Policy.</p>



<p>As a result,<strong> the National Policy for Education (NPE)</strong> was declared in 1968 which has been made responsible for considerable expansion of education all over the country at all levels. However, due to a lack of financial and administrative support, gaps in implementation remained. In 1986 the government published a document that acted as a base for a new NPE. Even it was not able to bring adequate results.</p>



<p>Then in 2002, the 86th amendment to the constitution provided the Right to Education as Fundamental Right under Article 21-A. The same amendment provided for follow-up legislation that gave birth to the Right to Education Act (RET) 2009 and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) which was declared as apex monitoring authority of RTE. The government is committed to providing universal elementary education (primary and upper primary) for all children aged 6-14 years of age through its program called Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).</p>



<h4><strong>Law For Education In India:</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The education</strong> system has been focused in India since the pre-independence period. However, since post-independence various efforts are being made to make the education system better. Different laws, policies, and programs have been introduced from time to time for the free and compulsory use of children. The landmark law for education in India is Right to Education (RTE) which was introduced in the year 2009 and came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> April 2010.</p>



<h4>Right to Education Act (RTE) 2009:</h4>



<p>The Right to Education Act provides free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14 years. This right enforces as Fundamental Right. Under this Act, it is mandatory to reserve 25% seats for the children belonging to disadvantaged sections of society which include scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, socially backward classes, and differently able children. This Act also set some standards for schools, which include pupil/teacher ratio, infrastructure, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Salient Features of RTE Act:</strong></p>



<p>1.  During elementary school, no child is required to submit any school fee or other stationery expenses.</p>



<p>2.  Punishments to children are forbidden. No teacher is allowed to inflict any corporal punishment or mental harassment on children.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be age-appropriate admission to children irrespective of their education level.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be separate toilets for the boys and girls in every school.</p>



<p>5.  No child should be detained up to elementary level.</p>



<p>6.  Curriculum should be devised as per the values enshrined in the constitution. It should ensure the all-round development of children.</p>



<p>7.  The teachers must be properly trained to impart education to elementary classes.</p>



<h4>Developments in Education Sector During Last Decade:</h4>



<p>Almost a decade ago, the government of India came up with a Right to Education (RTE) Act which made education a fundamental right and ensured free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years of age. Despite the structural loopholes and administrative lapses, the RTE Act has achieved success by realizing its prime objectives which include:</p>



<p><strong>1.  Increase in Enrollment:</strong></p>



<p>The RTE Act has successfully managed to increase enrollment of children in the elementary classes. As per the report, nationally, during 2009-2016, there has been a 19.4% increase in enrollment in elementary classes. The total enrollment stood at 927.2 % in schools in the year 2018[1].</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Improved Infrastructure Norms:</strong></p>



<p>The RTE Act has also achieved its objective of improved and proper infrastructure in schools. According to a report by ASER, the number of usable toilets has increased and has reached to 66.4% in 2018. There has been a significant increase in schools with boundary walls and kitchen shed. Also, an increase in the supply of books and other stationery items is observed in recent years.</p>



<p><strong>3.  Quality Education:</strong></p>



<p>Reports reveal that most of the states in India have adopted the curriculum as prescribed by the RTE Act. In schools (govt.), 80% of the teachers are professionally qualified to teach the children of elementary classes.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Adequate Girl Toilet Facilities:</strong></p>



<p>After the enforcement of the RTE Act, there has been an increase in the percentage of schools that are equipped with toilets for female children. Reports suggest that there has been an increase from 59% to 85% in the year 2018.</p>



<p><strong>5.  Maintenance of Pupil Teacher Ratio:</strong></p>



<p>There has been an increase in the number of teachers working in the government and aided schools which have resulted in a drop from 46% to 33% in the schools that don’t maintain the Pupil-Teacher Ratio.</p>



<h4>Shortcomings of Right to Education in India:</h4>



<p>The Right to Education (RTE) Act lacks teeth when it comes to enforcement of the provisions, the act suffers from some serious flaws. Some of them include:</p>



<p><strong>1.  No accountability:</strong></p>



<p>Right to Education Act, 2009 consists of 7chapters and 39 sections but not a single provision of this act deals with a penalty. There is no penalty for parents who deliberately don&#8217;t send their children to school and also no prescribed penalties for the government authorities which fail in discharging their respective duties under this Act.</p>



<p><strong>2.  Lack of policies and resources:</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;The government has not taken any major steps to enforce RTE. There is definitely a lack of resources and teachers. The share of schools that comply with the Right to Education guidelines has increased by a mere 3.7 percent during the last decade which is too low. The government is working very slowly in the implementation of the RTE Act. RTE Act 2009 fails to provide quality education to the children due to a lack of professionally qualified teachers.</p>



<p><strong>3.  Failure to provide full assistance:</strong></p>



<p>The 25% of seats reserved for EWS (economically weaker section) in private or unaided schools, even if the state paid for the tuition, who would pay for the rest? Who would pay for uniform, books, and the extra reading material, the dress for the annual day dance, the shoes, transport, and much more? This provision needs alteration and the state government should open its pockets to pay extra charges that the private schools are charging.</p>



<p><strong>4.  Socialization barriers for special abled children:</strong></p>



<p>This act contains a clause that motivates the elementary education of children with disabilities at home which is a good step but it leads to depression in children because such children are not able to socialize. The infrastructure of the schools doesn’t have adequate facilities for such children.</p>



<p><strong>5.  Another major flaw of the RTE Act,</strong> 2009 is that the act applies only to majority run schools; all minority educational run institutions are exempted from the provisions of this Act.</p>



<h4>Steps to Make Right to Education More Effective:</h4>



<p>Although the right to education has changed the education system in India yet there are many things to be done to make it more effective. Few steps which need to be taken include:</p>



<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Give incentives for schooling</strong>:</p>



<p>&nbsp;In poor families, kids are seen as helping hands, the more the better. They help in household chores and in the farm, besides earning money from labor jobs. Their contribution is quite significant for the survival of the family as a whole. Sending them to school takes this support away from the family. Hence, in order to educate them the following steps are an absolute necessity:</p>



<p>a)&nbsp; &nbsp; Monetary support to parents for sending kids to school.</p>



<p>b)&nbsp; &nbsp; Mid-day meal schemes etc.</p>



<p><strong>2.  Establish ownership and responsibility</strong>:</p>



<p>&nbsp;Particularly in the rural and poor areas, people’s representatives – MPs, MLAs, Sarpanchs’ – should be made responsible for the smooth functioning of the schools in their areas. Local relevant NGOs and other organizations may also be involved. They can provide support through the School Management Committees.</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>Focus on teacher training programs:</strong></p>



<p>The quality of teachers is the backbone of any teaching program. Untrained or unmotivated teachers can mar any program, no matter how ambitious it is. Creating a standard training program to train and generate quality teachers is crucial for the RTE Act to produce meaningful results.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Use computer and satellite technology to create awareness and interest:</strong></p>



<p>Create mobile units that pay visits to different schooling centers, particularly in remote areas, and show relevant films to both the teachers and the students. This will help sustain interest and arouse curiosity. Even visiting once in a fortnight or month would serve the purpose.</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong>  <strong>Easily accessible schools</strong>:</p>



<p>The Government should also focus on the construction of schools at an easily accessible distance. Traveling long distances to reach schools is the key factor for dropping out of school. The government should identify places near land dwellings so that children don’t face any troubles reaching schools.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong>  <strong>Awareness Campaigns:</strong></p>



<p>There must be more and more awareness among the common masses regarding the importance of education and the facilities available under the RTE Act.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Education undoubtedly remains the most important part of an individual. Knowledge brings prosperity to a nation. However, the nation as a whole is liable to provide for the proper provision and implementation of education in the country. India has recognized the right to education as a fundamental right for over a decade now, yet there remain primary loopholes that are responsible for its poor implementation. The primary fault of the RTE Act is its failure to recognize the main reason for the education crisis. The provisions of the RTE Act must be revisited with a view to making the education sector healthy and better. We need not write-off the RTE Act, 2009 as another failed legislation but should instead see it as a stepping stone to reform as per the people&#8217;s perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>South Korea is situated in East <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Asia" class="rank-math-link">Asia</a> and is the neighbouring country of Japan. It is on 45% of the southern portion of the Korean peninsula,&nbsp; bordered by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). The capital of South Korea is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Seoul" class="rank-math-link">Seoul (Sŏul). South Korea has an ancient history and has come a long way since the Korean War, which ended in 1953. Despite the miserable conditions brought by War South Korea has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest economies in the 1990s. South Korea even joined the OECD(Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). No doubt, the country has </a>suffered grave economic poverty but it has emerged as a fully functioning modern democracy and one of Asia’s most prosperous countries by today.</p>



<h4><strong>History of South Korea</strong></h4>



<p>Around 668 A.D. various competing Kingdoms were unified into a single regime on the Korean Peninsula. These succeeding dominions maintained Korean political and cultural independence for almost a thousand years. The last of the ruling powers were the Choson Dynasty until the nineteenth century. Korea has survived many invasions by Japan and the Manchus of East Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the end of the 19th century, Korea made small success in relation to trade and diplomatic relations with western powers. By the beginning of the 20th century Japan, Russia, and China competed to take over the Korean Peninsula. Japan succeeded and annexed it over 5 years later after the Russo- Japanese War. This colonial rule was up to 35 years and after the Japanese were defeated in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union divided this peninsula into two zones. After two years, the pro-U.S. The Republic of Korea (or South Korea) was established with its capital Seoul. In the north, the Soviets put Kim II Sung as the first chief of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), better known as North Korea. South Korea’s announcement of independence in 1950 led North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, to occupy its neighbor in an attempt to recover control of the entire peninsula. U.S. and United Nations troops fought beside South Korean forces in the <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.history.com/topics/korean-war">Korean War</a>, which cost some 2 million lives before it ended in 1953.</p>



<h4><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Social Progress</strong></h4>



<p>According to EAI Issue Briefing on “South Korea’s Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Better Life For Girls Initiative” by Eun Mee Kim, the South Korean administration has promised to make up to Sustainable development goals. In its development, cooperative policies, and implementation plans, it has mentioned that it will implement SDGs to the fullest. Even Before the beginning of the SDG era South Korea announced various initiatives they would implement while aiming for achieving SDGs. Many of these initiatives have come up because of South Korea’s own experience. Various initiatives like the New Village Movement, support for education and global citizenship education and global health security, poverty reduction, social-economic development. “Better Life For Girls”&nbsp; is considered an important factor to promote healthcare and education for girls.</p>



<p>East&nbsp; Asia is the leading subregion on the eradication of poverty and hunger in accordance with SDGs 1 and 2 of the United Nations. However, in respect of SDGs 11, 13, and 15 i.e., sustainable cities and communities, climate action, and life on land respectively, East Asia has declined in East Asia since 2000. All measured targets in Goals 4,5,7,11,12,13, and 14 which are quality education, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water respectively, can only be achieved through rigorous efforts with the situation needing a dramatic turnaround. At the Indicator level, the top five target that is in need of correction are protection of forests and ocean health, formal and informal education and training, the concentration of air pollutants, and the number of refugees.</p>

<h4><strong>Comparative Study of Exponential Growth</strong></h4>



<p>Measures are taken and the Government’s role; According to the Economic History Association, The Economic History of Korea is divided into three periods;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The period of Malthusian stagnation up to 1910, when Japan annexed Korea;</li><li>The colonial period from 1910-45, when the country embarked upon modern economic growth; and&nbsp;</li><li>The post-colonial decades, when living standards improved rapidly in South Korea.</li></ol>



<p>South Korean policymakers revived economic growth by encouraging native industrial films following other developing countries. The government targeted certain firms and gave them the privilege to buy foreign currencies and to borrow funds from banks at favorable rates. It also eradicated the tax barriers and imposed a ban on manufacturing imports with the hope that it would provide protection to the domestic firms and give them a chance to improvise their productivity through training and importing advanced technologies. In the 1990s&nbsp; relaxing Capital accounts followed which caused rapid accumulation of short-term external debts. This, together with a highly leveraged corporate sector and the banking sector destabilized by the financial repression, provided the background to the contagion of the financial crisis from Southeast Asia in 1997.</p>



<p>South Korean economy grew at an average annual rate of nearly 9% during the last three decades and per capita income increased more than a hundredfold. South Korea got transformed into an industrial power because of highly skilled labor. Economic Growth was seen to be slowed in the late 20th century. In 1997 South Korea was forced to accept a $57 billion bailout from the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Monetary-Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), which is considered to be the largest rescue in the history of IMF. The country also changed the system of large families who owned business to liberalizing its economy. However, the country recovered its economic growth in the following years and the country gained its economic growth comparatively as it entered the 21st century.</p>



<p>With the growth of educational institutions, commercial and industrial enterprises, many people fled towards urban areas from rural areas. In particular, Seoul grew almost 10 fold to about 1o million people at the beginning of the 21st century. The same sort of growth was seen in the media sector, especially newspaper and magazine publishing. A purposive program was also initiated for the country&#8217;s transportation system to expand and modernize it.</p>



<p>The apparent social change in South Korea was the emergence of the middle class. Even a new elite class emerged from the habitual landholding class after the Land reform measures taken in the early 1950s and with the spread of modern education, which eventually vanished the once privileged Yangban (landholding) Class. As people migrated to urban areas there was a decline of the extended- family system as they started living in apartments as nuclear families and with family planning such significant social change took place.</p>



<p>In regard to Women Empowerment, there were campaigns held by women for complete legal equality and even were succeeded to get enhanced property ownership rights, the right to register as ahead of the family in a new family register system (hojŏk) that took effect in 2008. Under the older system, only men and their children were legally part of the father&#8217;s family register but not the mother. The introduction of the new system increased women’s legal standing in other matters as well be it divorce or child custody cases or in matters of inheritance (adopted and stepchildren rights to be equal to those of biological children).&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the early 21st century, South Korea achieved the aim of decreasing birth rates and less aging population by rapid urbanization, nuclear family system, and women’s active participation in the economy and lengthening life expectancies. The overall population is expected to decrease in the next decades as the government was concerned that fewer children and an aging society would slow economic growth and destabilize the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-security-government-program">social security</a> system in the future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ghaf5c3Z5FLgLutzRZxPSp_as5K6S8FT8YvqZEVFIh3KD4hHA2AQh4rvZqjhQI1oojTCNilKxpzk7BbJ-MKbYHUtDJCKJpvk5An5dPbgeP64ujlcqdLp7zQaYiNofsJS76DfPg" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>South Korea&#8217;s Developmental Model as an Inspiration for other Countries</strong></h4>



<p>South Korea is known for its fast economic development. It is perceived that one should learn from the developmental strategies of Korea. South Korea&#8217;s economic strategy began with an agricultural-based economy in the 1960s and became the 12th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP(Gross Domestic Product) by 2020. South Korea&#8217;s economic success is attributed to policy reforms involving opening the country to foreign markets. Export-orientated policies were an important factor in economic growth. South Korea is among the top 10 exporters in the world and its export percentage was reported at 44.01 % in 2018. An improvement in the business environment and Policies incentivizing investment in innovation were factors that have contributed to the increase in international trade and industrialization in South Korea. Such factors played an important role in uplifting investment, production, communication, and, eventually, economic growth, innovation, and technology being South Korean major factors establishing export competitiveness and led to the country&#8217;s significant economic rise over the past decades. The Human Resource Development, The adaptation of An Outward-Looking Strategy (Labor Intensive Manufacturing), and Raising funds to foster needed industrial development led to the Economic Booming in South Korea.</p>



<p>Other countries cannot achieve fast growth by just following Korean strategies as the economic, social, and political environment of each developing country are different. And there are strategies adopted by Korea which were important factors of growth but later on created problems. As every country has its own unique environment, it is not possible for them to adopt such strategies precisely but can follow some part of it after well consideration keeping in view their resources and infrastructures.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>South Korea is one of the fastest-growing economies in the World. Despite the Korean war which rendered the country poor in a miserable condition, thus the country was not only fighting for economic problems but for survival. South Korea managed to be the 12th largest economy in the World. Major factors in the Country’s economic development involve high levels of domestic savings, private domestic investments, and rapidly growing human capital. The Economic Booming of South Korea drives the attention of developing countries to follow their strategy. Considering South Korea’s relatively limited geographical size, natural resources, and population size, an aging population increases the threat that South Korea’s economy might have a downfall. South Korea needs to continue its support in innovation and a favorable business environment for the maintenance of sustainable economic growth.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>In India, no doubt there are special laws relating to children but still, they are deprived of even basic human rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of India and other legislation. In India, the problem of child labour is quite alarming. As per Census 2011, the total child population in India in the age group (5-14) years is 259.6 million. Of these, 10.1 million (3.9% of total child population) are working, either as ‘main worker’ or as ‘marginal worker’. In addition, more than 42.7 million children in India are out of school. [i]</p>



<h4><strong>Effects of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Child labour deprives the child of an opportunity for education, play, and recreation. It affects physical growth, normal development, and prevents their preparation for responsibility. There are a number of risks that are experienced by working children. The worst effect of child labour is that it interferes with the education of the children which decreases their vocational development. They neither acquire any skill nor receive any education as a result they remain illiterate and oppressed. Most of all it gives birth to a number of economic problems such as the use of labour at its lowest productivity implying thereby an inefficient utilization of labor-power.</p>



<p>The most affected aspect of working children is their health. The working children are more vulnerable to tuberculosis and bronchitis, muscle atrophy, weakening and malformation of bones, eye diseases, stunted growth, finger arthritis, damage to fingernails, and malnutrition.</p>



<p>The worst forms of child labour which include slavery and similar practices like trafficking, forced labour, etc. have severe effects on children like depression, premature aging, malnutrition, and drug dependency. It endangers the child‘s dignity and morals. It endangers their innocence.</p>



<h4><strong>Constitutional Safeguards in India for Children</strong></h4>



<p>Keeping in view the gigantic problem of child labour, the Indian Parliament enacted appropriate laws for protecting children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is, in a way, likely to be hazardous or harmful to their health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. The Constitution of India has enough provisions in this regard.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Article 15(3)</strong> of the Constitution authorizes the state for making any special provision for women and children. </li><li><strong>Article 21 </strong>provides, no person shall be deprived of his life or his personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. </li><li><strong>Article 21A</strong> says the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6-14 years in such manners as the State may, by law, determine. </li><li><strong>Article 23</strong> says traffic in human beings and the beggar and other forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this position shall be an offense punishable in accordance with the law. </li><li>Under <strong>Article 24</strong> no child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. </li><li><strong>Article 39(E)</strong> says the State shall make its policy towards securing the health and strengths and the tender age of children are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength. Article 39 (E) enjoins that childhood and youth are to be protected against exploitation, against moral and material abandonment. </li><li>In <strong>Article 45</strong> the Constitution provides free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years. </li><li>The general provisions under<strong> Article 38, 42, 43, 45, and 47 of Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>, although do not deal directly with child welfare but provide a strategy for indirectly promoting the welfare of children.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Legislative Provisions for Protection of Child Labour</strong></h4>



<p>Notwithstanding the abovementioned constitutional provisions, there are a number of enactments in the country which protect and safeguard the interests of child labour.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Factories Act of 1881</strong> was the first law to define children and to prescribe prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 7 years of age. The Factories Act, 1911 prohibited employment of children in dangerous occupations and working during night hours. The first Convention of International Labour Organisation (ILO), compelled amendment of the Act in 1922, to raise the minimum age of a child to 15 years. However, children below the age of 12 years were prohibited from employment. The age rose to 13 years in 1935 under the Act. </li><li><strong>The Factories Act, 1948</strong>, prescribes prohibitory regulations for the employment of children below 14 years of age in any factory. </li><li><strong>India Mines Act, 1952 </strong>prohibits employment of children below 16 years in any underground mines.</li><li><strong>Plantation Labour Act, 1951 </strong>prohibits employment less than the age of 12 years<strong>. </strong></li><li><strong>The Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961 </strong>absolutely prohibits the employment of children in motor transport. </li><li><strong>The Shops and Commercial Establishments Acts of different States, </strong>also prohibit employment of children in the shops, hotels, dhabas, street shops, and commercial places. </li><li><strong>Besides the above legislations, The Apprentice Act, 1961, </strong>The Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966, The Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 provide that employment of children is a punishable offense. </li></ul>



<p>As required by ILO Convention and as envisaged in the National Seminar on Employment of Children in 1975, to prevent exploitation of children, the Indian Government felt to enact a single Act to deal with the prohibition of child labour.</p>



<h4><strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act</strong></h4>



<p>To provide uniformity of age and to prescribe stricter punishments, the Indian Parliament enacted a single Act to deal with the exploitation of children,<em> i.e.</em>, <strong>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986</strong>. The Act prohibited the employment of children below the age of 14 years in certain occupations and processes. These include the transport of passengers, goods, and mails and other hazardous work in railways and ports, the process like Beedi making, cement manufacturing, manufacturing of matches and explosives, mica cutting, soap manufacturing, wool cleaning, and building and construction industries. The Act also provides for regulations of conditions of work by prescribing minimum working hours, prohibiting work at night, prohibiting overtime work, and weekly holiday. Also, the Act provides measures for the health and safety of child workers. It emphasized the maintenance of a register having details of children if employed by any organization. Indirect support was extended for such an evil practice which should be totally prohibited irrespective of the nature of employment. <strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012</strong>, has several features that are child-centered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Act tried to fill the gaps which existed due to earlier Acts. However, this Act also proved to be ineffective in curbing the problem. As per UNICEF (2011), the number of child labourers in India is 10.1 million of which 5.6 million are boys and 4.5 million are girls [ii]. Thus, with modernization, the Government of India tried to keep pace with changing times where child labour has included many other forms of exploitation and the government brought an amendment in 2016 which brought many changes in the Act. Some major changes were –</p>



<ul><li>While the original act allowed the employment of children above 14 years in hazardous occupations and processes, the Amendment banned the employment of children at such places up to the age of 18 years.</li><li>The Amendment calls for stricter punishments for violations.</li><li>While the Act prohibited the employment of children up to 14 years in specified categories such as domestic work, automobile workshops, and other hazardous industries; the Amendment gives certain exceptions where the children of such age are allowed to work, like in sporting activities but only in non-school hours and without a subordinate relationship of work and labour. The government justified the exceptions to strike a balance between the need for education for children and the reality of the socio-economic condition and social fabric in the country. But, this Amendment was criticized for taking away the basic protections for some of the most vulnerable workers, and some well-known child rights activists while criticizing the new Amendment say that it permits children to be confined to work instead of being in school because allowing children to work before and after school creates an imbalance in their lives and the children cannot be expected to do multi-tasks at such a tender age and as a result, they are forced to give up their education.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>C</strong>hallenges</h4>



<p>Despite such legislation and rights guaranteed by the Constitution, India continues to be among the countries which have the highest percentage of child labour. The main reasons for this are the economic condition of India, the imbalance that exists in its societies, and most of all the weak implementation mechanisms. In addition to these reasons are, namely:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Poverty &#8211;</strong> It is the single important reason for child labour. The poor parents in order to supplement their income allow the children to work even on unremunerative jobs. Abject poverty and unemployment force the children to take up unremunerative jobs. Thus, economic compulsions weigh heavily on the consciousness of the poor parents and they would not mind colluding with their children’s employers in violating the laws and putting their children under the risks of inhuman exploitation. Parents want their children to earn for themselves as early as possible, much better, if they become a source of income to the family. </li></ul>



<p>Even the highest court of the country has observed that the child labour in India is purely on account of economic reasons that the parents often want their children to be employed to augment their meager earnings and this problem cannot be solved by mere legislation because of the poverty and destitution in the country. In order to eradicate this problem, it is essential that a child should have been able to receive proper education with a view to equipping itself to become a useful member of society and to play a constructive role in the socio-economic development of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Loss of an earning member of the family.</li><li>The poor conviction rate of the violators.</li><li>Many employers prefer to engage children because they are cheap. Moreover, children tend to be less troublesome, more disciplined, and highly adaptable.</li><li>Absence of any state-sponsored scheme of family allowance.</li><li>Nonexistence of any general scheme of compulsory education up to a minimum age.</li><li>The evasion of existing laws for the protection of children.</li><li>Even the social structure system is responsible for child labour as the social structure is characterized by the caste system. The members of the low castes and down-trodden communities are expected to be for the services of the upper castes and thus, they are deprived of their aspirations.</li></ul>



<p>The problem of child labour in India is deeply rooted in the exploitative socio-economic set-up and poor and backward economy. Ignorance by people, lack of opportunities, and other socio-economic institutions add to this problem.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>No doubt there are a number of legislations and constitutional safeguards for child welfare to overcome child labour and to avoid the situations that come as a consequence of child labour. At an international level, different organizations are also working for the same cause. But still, there are a lot of efforts needed to create an environment that is free from child abuse. The instances discussed in the various sections of the writing indicate how far India is in eradicating child labour and how hard work it needs to do for the welfare of the poor, ignorant, and unheard children. The problem lies in the implementation side. The States should devise effective mechanisms for the proper implementation of laws. The more responsibility lies on the parents who should not force their children to indulge in such occupations. Awareness building programs shall be conducted with parents and communities through which people at large can understand the ill-effects of child labour. This problem needs the support of every person in the society and we should discourage the people to employ children in factories, homes, shops, etc. and the initiatives of the civil societies also need to be appreciated.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Terrorism has been a major issue in the Philippines for decades altogether, ranking ninth among the countries most affected by terrorism. Both communist, nationalist rebels and Islamic separatist insurgencies have put havoc on the nation. As a result of which, thousands of Filipinos have been killed in bombings, assassinations, kidnapping attempts, and executions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to address this issue, in June 2020, the House of Representatives in the Philippines passed a bill called Anti-Terrorism Bill. The current President of the Philippines, namely, Rodrigo Duterte certified this bill as an ‘urgent’ one, with the aim to respond to the threat in the country. However, this bill has been subject to a lot of criticism, demonstrations, and protests among politicians, religious organizations, civilians, and celebrities as well. They believe that the Anti-Terrorism Bill will infringe human rights and other civil liberties in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines is a South Asian Archipelagic State. It is the unitary Presidential Constitutional Republic, where the President acts both as the head of State and of Government.</p>



<h4><strong>Current Legal Scenario</strong></h4>



<h4><strong>What is Anti- Terrorism Act?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The Anti-Terrorism Bill was sent by Presidential Spokesperson for the President’s assent and was signed into Action by the president on the 3rd of July. It aims to protect the country from Domestic and Foreign Terrorist Attacks. The Act states that “any law enforcer to arrest and detain without warrant ‘a person suspected of committing any of the acts’ punishable under the major for 14 calendar days, extendable by 10 days and the suspected “terrorists” can also be placed under surveillance for 60 days, extendable by up to 30 more days, by the police or military”. This Act also removed the provision of the previous Act which provided that the acquitted suspects who were arrested without a warrant to recover damages from the police for every day that he or she was detained. Further, the new Act regulates discourse of terrorism that, in the Philippines, the government uses to invalidate dissent, which is coming from Leftists and Communists.<img loading="lazy" width="602" height="400" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UB-pZrP977zHkLQNZPZ8dnkqE3cWg86oXPME8wrJW1bjcqDmfBdspmNuhYT9kFQnhtdtHb60YzLVdxldH7FYVfKT16iRSrzUn9cVJ5MaGIMZMdQuEBGMA3pTQUdQfGG6c47KIg"></p>



<p>It had never been seen in the history of the Philippine that the government authorized police to use such power over commoners. Also, police were earlier at least considering the consequences of arresting suspects without reason. But, now the police do not need to consider the same.</p>



<p><strong>According to the new Act, anyone among the following can be labeled as a ‘terrorist’:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Who engages in acts intended to cause death or serious physical injury to another person.</li><li>Who engages in acts intended to cause extensive damage to a government or public facility, place, or private property.</li><li>Who engages in acts intended to damage critical infrastructure.</li><li>Who develops, possesses, acquires, transports, or uses deadly explosive weapons.</li><li>Who releases dangerous substances, causes fire or floods with the aim to intimidate the public, government, or International organization.&nbsp;</li><li>Who is accused of inciting, conspiring, proposing, and participating in training, planning, and facilitation of terrorist attacks?</li></ol>



<p>Moreover, the Court of Appeals can declare any individual or organization as ‘terrorists’ in 72 hours, upon application from the Department of Justice. Those found guilty will be imprisoned for life without Parole.</p>



<p>As long as advocacy, work stoppages, and humanitarian action is done “without intention to cause physical harm or death to a person, to endanger a person’s life, or to create a serious risk to public safety”; they are exempted from the definition of terrorism. The attributability for law enforcement agents has also been relaxed, who may breach the rights of the accused, particularly those in detention.</p>



<h4><strong>Why was this Act Needed?</strong></h4>



<p>The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 is the amended version of the Human Security Act, which was enacted by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2007, in order to tackle militants in the Southern Philippines. The Act has been put forth in order to battle Asia’s longest Communist insurgency, by the Communist Party of the Philippines, known as the New People’s Army (NPP), and a thirty years reign of terror by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). In 2017, Marawi, a Southern city of the Philippines was subjected to siege by Islamic state-aligned militants. Even, last year the Southern region of the country was jolted by a suicide bombing, allegedly conducted by a militant group known as Islamic State in Sulu (IS Sulu). </p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="286" height="190" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WeM1OIAMWVgrWNRNoOS0Mjr0RA8eYJnQuzIxUVeeoE8qSzyUIl6vGFLrY1IDapvaGfHMpcR9JfOoUp2mRAfDwhgw4wwSr3DTR0sv6JQcAO5-nczCnm6Ys9IQeE84BLiBQoXLJQ"></p>



<p><em>These insurgencies have adversely affected the economic sector in the countryside, hampered investments, and have resulted in cross-fires</em>.</p>



<p>Lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic also did not stop the terror, as reported that more than 6,000 people were evacuated from the country&#8217;s southern region. Where, Communist rebels’ and Islamic militants attacked soldiers, who were securing distribution of financial aid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proponents of the Act are of the opinion that due to the leniency for the offenders and a lot of restrictions on the law enforcer, the previous act has not been efficient enough to curb terrorism. Further, the Act provides the administration with immense power to deal with these security challenges. It expands the range of punishable acts to include preparatory and mobilization activities for the commission of terrorism. &nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="578" height="420" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tyRjXWxgyeRVSDnD4GZjUgACXLp1cbWZsP8h3IQrtDZ7FOhSyhuagVIAD2dPUWwV_wcUi6vXa7JMT7CsH0FxvdL2MlAQEBOoo5yJLbU0lWRRxse59ItCFsIpvXkI08WjYUuIhw"></p>



<h4><strong>Why is this Act a Problem?</strong></h4>



<p>The new Anti-Terrorism Act is opposed because of the following reasons:</p>



<ul><li>The Philippines Commission on Human Rights is of the opinion that the wide definition of terrorism in the new Act makes a way for possible abuse. Critics of the Act pointed to a recent example where the government used the force of law against civilians who were voicing displeasure over dealing with coronavirus by the administration as proof that Duterte’s government could misuse this vague definition.&nbsp;</li><li>Anti-Terrorism council which will be made up of top cabinet officials has been set up by the government in order to define what constitutes terrorism. This council can designate anyone and everyone as a terrorist.&nbsp;</li><li>The act may be a step for amelioration; however, the timing is not. It is a well-known fact that the world is struggling with the covid-19 and to address the problems of this pandemic must be the foremost priority of the administration. Rather than, coming up with a legal issue in these hard times.</li><li>The International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines warned that (ICHRP) there will be an escalation of rights abuses with the coming of the new law. The right to security and privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to due process will all be curtailed. All these rights are guaranteed to Filipinos by their constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other internationally agreed covenants that are signed by the Philippine.&nbsp;</li><li>Citizens fear that the new Act can be used against any critics, as it will restrain legitimate dissent, giving greater opportunities to authorities to curtail the rights of people without even holding them accountable.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Threat to Mindanao Minorities</strong></h4>



<p>An autonomous region in the south of the Philippines known as “Bangsamoro” is in transition after years of fighting between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Marawi siege delayed the passage of Bangsamoro basic law and hindered the harmonization across communities in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to several reports, due to a prolonged history of bias, the Muslim and Moro minorities are most vulnerable not only to terrorist attacks but to warrantless arrests under the guise of “counterterrorism”. Where Muslims are profiled as violent terrorists even today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, the women of Moro and Muslim minorities face heightened discrimination, especially the ones covering their heads. Instead of seeing widowed women and orphaned children (by conflict), as someone who can inform police for change, counter-terrorism makes police see them as vulnerable to being recruited in terrorism.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s believed that this Act will make it easier to target Muslims and undermine efforts of pacification.</p>



<h4><strong>Protests Against the Bill</strong></h4>



<p>Ever since the bill was proposed, there has been tension throughout the country. People from different human rights groups, educational institutes, and church organizations have come out on the streets and are protesting against this bill amidst the pandemic. Rallies have been carried out in the capital city Manila and other major cities as well. In spite of mass gatherings being prohibited, protest leaders reportedly said that they were compelled to come out on streets to save the country from crossing a dangerous line that violated their freedom of expression. Also, protests were carried out by thousands at the University of Philippines’ main campus at Manila. Here the protesters tried to maintain distance and all wore face masks as a safeguard, while holding placards and chanting slogans questioning the timing of the legislation.<img loading="lazy" width="566" height="362" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gh3zsG9qDI9pp30dYEviM-5iYUZ4e5sERJgeAMvdIkWJUOQvsBEFmQXhOYMav67-XDjoWkfZhSiJW_g2X1gBU6l9yQwdTVc64sQXnciZprXR2lHFVsX75yRg9-41RHulIojyIg"> In another university, situated in Cebu city, the Anti-terror bill rally was also carried out and it is reported that around 30 protestors were trapped inside the university for hours, few among which were arrested during the dispersal, even when the Act provides the right of peaceful protest to people. Some protestors stated the new Act as oppressive and such, which they believe will suppress their right to protest and speak against the wrongdoings of the society while subjugating their ministry of compassion, justice, and peace. Further, they opined that the government should have focussed on problems like poverty, food shortage, medical services, and unemployment instead.</p>



<h4><strong>Legal Challenges</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;The controversial Anti-Terrorism legislation is giving opportunities to opponents to raise immediate legal challenges before the Courts regarding the constitutionality of some of its provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report, an opposition Senator, among the two who voted against the bill is likely to make efforts to challenge it directly to the country’s highest court. Also, a former Supreme Court judge had earlier affirmed that as soon as this bill turns into law it can be questioned directly before the High Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reportedly, the lawyers were waiting for the President’s signature in order to file their legal challenge. Consequently, four petitions were quickly filed after the act was enacted before the Supreme Court, describing its provisions to be vague and violating Human Rights and constitutional principles.</p>



<p>These petitioners filed for the writ of certiorari and prohibition upholding a prayer for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) chairperson and its members. Two of the petitioners pleaded that the Supreme Court after following the procedure should annul the new act for being unconstitutional. While other petitioners only asked for nullification of some sections of the law.</p>



<h4><strong>Response of Government to the Challenges</strong></h4>



<p>According to the reports, in response to all the challenges President Duterte addressed the nationals to not be afraid of the new law. Further, saying that this bill is not a problem for law-abiding citizens and only those people should fear who are planning to bomb churches and public utilities to frustrate the nation.</p>



<p>More than 40,000 people’s lives have been put to an end due to the conflict between the government and the armed wing of the communist party.</p>



<p>In addition to this, the government is of the opinion that people are misunderstanding the powers of the Anti-Terror Council as the council can designate individuals as terrorists only if they are:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Already designated as terrorists by United Nation Security Council in its list and</li><li>If there is evidence that a person may be a terrorist as defined by this law.</li></ol>



<p>The effect of designation does not lead to detention but the council can only forward such designation to the Anti-money laundering council, which will look into the assets. So, it is actually the courts of law through a whole judicial process that can see with certainty and beyond any reasonable doubt that a person or a group of persons are terrorists.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>The new anti-terrorism act has enhanced the power and discretion on its use. Now, the question remains will it be used with a high degree of rationality and attributability or not.</p>



<p>The country’s security agencies are facing trust issues while emphasizing the need to support reformists in these organizations to ramp up professionalization and capacity development and further training. Besides, the supporters of the act are working on the presumption that the security, executive, and judicial institutions would give regard to human rights and would exercise a vigorous degree of accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the contrary, the response of the citizens against the act could be inferred as an exhibition of reduced trust in government institutions given the task of anti-terrorism efforts. They want the government to revoke the act, reopen deliberations and listen to people across society, especially the ones who have been victims of both terrorist violence and abusive counter-terror laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, while any form of terrorism is intolerable, public security can never be at the expense of fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>South Sudan, officially referred to as the Republic of South Sudan is a landlocked country in East-Central Africa. It got independence in 2011 from the Republic of Sudan, emerging as becoming the world’s newest country. After almost nine years of gaining independence, South Sudan should be a country full of hope and new possibilities, but instead, it is in the grip of a massive humanitarian crisis.</p>



<p>Political conflict, ecological imbalance compounded by economic woes and drought, has caused massive displacement, raging violence, and dire food shortage. The ongoing conflict and insecurity have pushed millions to the brink of starvation for years. In 2017, famine or near-famine conditions were reported in some countries, and South Sudan was one among them. In February 2017, famine was declared in South Sudan and has remained a persistent threat ever since.</p>



<h4><strong>When did the Hunger Crisis Start in South Sudan?</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan gained independence in 2011 from the Republic of Sudan. In 2005, a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), also known as the Naivasha Agreement, was signed between the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the Government of Sudan. This agreement ended more than two decades of war between rebels in South Sudan and the Government in Khartoum. Amidst the signing of the CPA and independence, South Sudan made important progress in state-building. National and State governments were formed along with the institutions that were necessary to ensure the rule of law.<br><strong>According to the World Bank, they made certain social and economic progress like:</strong></p>



<p>• The number of children enrolled in primary school increased six-fold between 2005 to 2012 from 300,000 to 1.8 million.<br>• Infant mortality decreased by 25%.<br>• The number of skilled midwives grew.<br>• Polio was eradicated.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this celebration was short-lived. The ruling political party (Sudan People’s Liberation Movement) that originally led the way for independence is now divided and fighting for power. After two years of its independence, it plunged into conflict. In December 2013, this political infighting erupted into violence in the streets of Juba, the capital of South Sudan, after South Sudan’s current President Salva Kiir accused its vice president Riek Machar of an attempted coup and the fight started between two factions of the Government. Violence spread like wildfire in South Sudan, displacing thousands of civilians who rushed to seek refuge in U.N bases. and This fight is continuing to date, becoming an increasingly brutal civil war, and affecting the entire country.</p>



<p>In 2015 after peace negotiations, both parties signed an Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS). Unfortunately, this agreement did not end the violence instead, which has spread across the entire country, now splintered along ethnic, political, and regional lines. The conflict has affected nearly everyone and raised deep economic and social problems in the country.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="226" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\graph.PNG" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lpAg2_sWFsXdsroUGwSknO0Xc0O71adIYZgdHwGFlc1BFM-pjxqD7okbo8O7dmeau3nMZ6mnO2h6cL0wB9YriIdtuta_IPLEUFvr7JcN2CMNYrjUk_MYcISlyYYa-mj7L0BEIQ"></p>



<p>The ongoing conflict and insecurity have pushed millions to the brink of starvation for years. In 2017, famine was declared there. The famine crisis had taken a toll on the South Sudanese people making it difficult to access the required necessities of life like food, healthcare. Has destroyed everything in South Sudan like crops, health centers, and other required necessities of life. People there are without food and the economy has collapsed. Women and children are most vulnerable to the effects of food insecurity, malnutrition, and conflict.</p>



<p>Famine was declared officially in 2017 when people have already begun to starve to death. It is the diplomatic equivalent of a seven-alarm fire. Food shortage and famine in South Sudan are not sudden occurrences like the earthquake in Haiti and flooding in Indonesia but are rather a result of the prolonged and slow process of combined factors. Famine in the region is not caused by climate changes but it is the result of deeper structural and geopolitical anomalies. The maxim is true that famine does not result purely from natural causes but is “man-made”. Such a description, however, avoids any real accountability for those that have caused the crisis. South Sudan famine would be more accurately described as the “government made”. The most immediate cause lies within the tactics employed by the South Sudan government and its principal Rebel opponent in fighting the war.</p>



<p>Government and Rebel forces attack civilian areas much more than they attack each other. They target means of survival of civilian populations deemed to be unsupportive. The government has also concentrated attacks on sites where agricultural production traditionally fed large parts of South Sudan, not only leading to massive human displacement but also devastating local grain production which leads to hyperinflation in food prices.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\graph 3.PNG" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6387em3bns9BWM4CFsrg6M0aQhYxEtIA8uo-ZCbQ7nYhb3SNEA359D3YTzk5b56kbQEFH-aLDsCBs08qMWruiZVw6kFqr5uz4zRQthLwqRsAwxE63uUu8WeS6kWv0_VvxEb_Qw" width="383" height="263"></p>



<h4>What’s Happening in South Sudan Now?</h4>



<p>A handful of peace agreements between the current President Salva Kiir and the former rebel leader Riek Machar have been signed over the course of the war – the most recent in 2018 –but the treaty have been repeatedly violated. While reported incidents of conflict have decreased somewhat since the new deal, the situation in South Sudan remains highly unstable and outbreaks of violence continue to occur. Relatively small numbers of people have started to return home in light of the tenuous peace agreement, but new displacement remains high. Those affected are struggling to survive after years of a protracted conflict that has destroyed livelihoods, forced people to leave their homes, disrupted planting, and eliminated critical coping resources, like savings and livestock.</p>



<p>Many humanitarian organizations, including Mercy Corps, are working with the UN, using both private contributions and funding from the international community, to address the urgent needs of people in South Sudan.</p>



<h4>Effects of Conflict</h4>



<p>One of the worst hunger crises of the past 25 years was the famine in East Africa in 2011/2012.<br>Following a power crisis that erupted in 2013, South Sudan has spiraled into a conflict, which has spread across most parts of the country and resulting in the death of tens of thousands of people. The ongoing conflict that has engulfed the country of South Sudan results in high food prices, economic disruption, and low agricultural production. Due to these reasons, the UN and the Government of South Sudan were forced to declare famine in 2017.</p>



<p>Famines are an acute food crisis, usually after drought or due to armed conflict. Famine is the worst form of food shortage. In addition to old people, babies and small children are especially threatened by starvation. According to the United Nations definition (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), there is a famine if at least: 20% of households suffer from extreme food shortages, 30% of the population is acutely malnourished; and 2 out of every 10,000 people, or 4 children, die daily from food shortages.</p>

<p><em>Food insecurity in South Sudan as of September 2018</em>.</p>



<p>Hunger anywhere can have long-term, debilitating consequences, but it can be particularly threatening during a complex crisis just like the one in South Sudan. When people go hungry, they have trouble staying healthy and become more susceptible to dangerous diseases. Their bodies are not as strong or productive as they could be, which makes it difficult for them to work, find food, and keep their families safe at a time when they urgently need the strength to do so.</p>



<p>Children’s development is also seriously impacted by hunger. Without proper nutrition, they don’t hit critical developmental milestones, which may permanently inhibit their ability to reach their full potential find out and function for the rest of their lives. Hungry children don’t learn as well, and they are also at a higher risk of disease.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="339" height="207" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\child.PNG" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lkMlY2lqUhlSRYDiey5xxydZgKd_rKA-eIPNPi5pBD2319pMA8S__TR-Nb1lx7Vt2B5UfZgsmRGvtKNAMyNrE6wZH_mM1Waa6VWaflQIkUjhPuYh9FetcV8TxfLtg8xR1L8OBQ"></p>



<p><em>Nyaguande, 4, lives with her family in a displacement site since fleeing attacks at their home. More than half the populations of loopholes uprooted South Sudanese people are children.<br></em>According to <strong>United Nation Agencies</strong>, this conflict has pushed South Sudanese into hunger. Nearly 60% of the population (6.1 million people) has been pushed into extreme hunger. Children, there are at imminent risk of death from malnutrition. Children who survive malnutrition in early childhood face lifelong damage to their health and their physical and cognitive development. Even short bouts of hunger and malnutrition carry long-term cognizance.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Jeremy Hopkins</strong>, the South Sudan representative for the UN Children’s Agency, more than 2,00,000 children were at risk of death from malnutrition in the country.</p>



<p><strong>The World Food Programme reported</strong> that 67% of the South Sudanese population (4.9 million people) needed food urgently, and at least 100,000, according to the UN, were in imminent danger of death by starvation.</p>



<p>According to the <strong>Action Against Hunger report</strong>, conflict pushed more people into hunger in 2018, and malnutrition rates remained high. Two million people were initially displaced, and 2.3 million people have become refugees. The country is marked by excessive gender-based violence, declining economic opportunities, and strained health centers. Half of the children are not attending schools, and two-thirds of the population has no access to safe water.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\cap.PNG" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/h_ea2m44qFEvzhjrNVsWgpo7m7WBJBw8PaEqOzvRDIKS8G1t7YCSItdBwUVq3lkmWdCZcCa2DDJIfgTkXvTeMheQyiy8dcM7DPr0tC9F3NqBDrztCzAzHcYnFd27yo6unmfVMw" width="425" height="232"></p>



<p><em>South Sudanese children fleeing from recent fighting in Lasu, Central Equatoria, stand in church after crossing the border into the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br></em>According to the <strong>United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization</strong>, many families have exhausted every means they have for survival. The people were predominantly farmers and war has disrupted agriculture. They have lost their livestock, even their farming tools.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Mercy Corps</strong>,<strong> more than 3 million </strong>people had been displaced by ongoing violence across the country, forcing families to abandon agricultural land and livestock to survive with few food resources. Over 4 million people &#8211; 1 in 3 – have been forced to flee their homes due to this brutal war. Nearly 2.5 million have fled to neighboring countries. There are now 1 million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, making up about half of the country’s total refugee population.</p>



<p>There were significant challenges for agencies delivering food in famine-affected areas. Civilians reported that the food they received was taken by soldiers involved in the fighting.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" alt="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\pic.PNG" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y6fv8aP4OWjTSd0YG-xziVgFa6za5_pWy4aGGKd3d-P1LneILWVMF0d2LO6MFqEEGsLlcLBBg6yRnEH-5KyRqxK3MSkQonCeY-whVbdvCK6Tco-bNsJBKtUAGhyjl7yX2mZhUQ" width="443" height="278"></p>

<h4><strong>Economic and Human costs of conflict</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan has very fertile soil and significant oil deposits. Its economy is dependent on exporting oil. Oil is near all that South Sudan exports. It generates about 60% of the country’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product). In 2016, South Sudan&#8217;s oil-dependent economy faced multiple major shocks including the eruption of conflict in the capital city Juba, disruptions in agricultural production, and a significant drop in international oil prices. The poor performance of the economy triggered several economic crises, the cost of necessities, particularly food skyrocketed. The price of staple foods, such as Sorghum, maize, and beans, are at record highs.</p>



<p>The human cost of the conflict is enormous. The World Bank estimates that poverty had risen significantly from 44.7% in 2011 to 66% in 2016. Poverty is so deeper than in the period before the conflict. According to the World Bank, there is significant gender disparity, indicating few educational opportunities for the generation of women. Male literacy is 40%, while the female literacy rate is only 16%. Other indicators of poverty include high infant mortality rate and high maternal mortality rate.</p>



<h4><strong>Who is Most Affected by this crisis?</strong></h4>



<p>Women and children are disproportionately impacted by the conflict in South Sudan. The majority of the population of the United Nations displacement sites is made up of women and children, with more than 60% of South Sudanese refugees being under age 18.</p>



<p>Additionally, sexual violence towards women and girls is pervasive. The United Nations recently reported a surge in sexual attacks, including women and girls experiencing abuse during raids on their homes. The people committing these crimes are rarely held responsible.</p>



<p>To make the situation even more difficult, women and girls continue to bear the burden of family caretaking even during crises crisis. In the face of increased violence, recurring displacement, and loss of livelihoods, daily tasks like collecting water and firewood make them continual targets for attack.</p>



<h4><strong>How is the Hunger Crisis being Tackled in South Sudan?</strong></h4>



<p>It is widely acknowledged that the South Sudan food emergency is man-made. Human actions, particularly the proliferation of Armed factions and military groups continue to make humanitarian response extremely difficult and restrict access to markets, farms, and medical services. However, there are national as well as international organizations that are working to mitigate the impact of the hunger crisis on the lives of south sudanase. Some of the organizations which are working in tackling the hunger crisis in South Sudan are:</p>



<p><strong>• United Nation Agencies</strong></p>



<p>The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (FAO), the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and World Food Programme (WFP) called for sustainable peace across the country, and unhindered, safe access to all areas where people who survived the fighting but are left without nothing are in, and need of life-saving assistance. According to Mahimbo Mdoe, UNICEF’s Representative in South Sudan, more than 80% of children treated recover, which makes it even more urgent to access those who have suffered the most as a result of the fighting. UNICEF and partners have admitted 147421 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition into various outpatient treatment programs (OTP) and stabilization centers since January 2018. So far, FAO supported 1.4 million farmers with agricultural seeds and tools during the main planting season so that they can increase cereal production. During the planting season, FAO distributes over 4,800 tons of crop seeds. WFP provides life-saving emergency food supplies, food in return for work to construct and rehabilitate community assets, food for school meals, and special products for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in children, and pregnant and nursing women. So far in 2018, WFP has reached 3.1 million people with 30,000 tons of food.</p>



<p><strong>• Non-Governmental Organization</strong></p>



<p>Oxfam has a strong and established team working tirelessly from 10 bases across the country, providing essential services and helping to keep people alive. According to them, they are working in South Sudan to deliver timely and effective humanitarian aid to help people affected by the conflict. It is currently supporting over 5,00,000 people with humanitarian assistance, including clean water, hygiene facilities, food, fuel, and income support.</p>



<p><strong>• Government Initiatives in tackling the crisis</strong></p>



<p>The Government of South Sudan is particularly concerned about hunger among South Sudanese school-aged children, many of whom rely heavily on free meals provided in schools. School meals for students in South Sudan are mainly provided by WFP, the same U.N. agency sounding the alarm over the potential famine. But WFP is only able to reach close to half a million students, against a total of 3 million to 3.5 million students.<br>In 2018, WFP and South Sudan’s government (Ministry of Education) launched a five-year strategy that aims to shift the current school meal set-up from relying solely on imported food to increase production for locally grown food. To increasingly using produce grown by local communities. The government is looking at external support to plug in additional resources and aims to increase its allocation for school meals.<br>In 2018, a Peace Agreement, R-ARCSS (Revitalization Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan) was signed between the current President Salva Kiir and the former rebel leader Riek Machar. As a result, Machar rejoined the Government and resumed his Vice President&#8217;s duties. This deal certainly offers a promising end to South Sudan’s conflict.<br>President Kiir also signed a declaration (Khartoum Declaration of Agreement) with the leaders of Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), giving amnesty to the troops, army generals, and leaders of SPLM. The amnesty included Vice President Machar which also and was an important gesture showing Kiir’s commitment to moving on from the senseless war.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>South Sudan, the world’s youngest country has the world’s highest rates of population growth and maternal mortality, and less than 30% of the population is literate. The country has abundant natural resources, but less than 200 miles of paved roads.</p>



<p>The Peace Agreement 2015 which was viewed as a milestone towards ending the conflict unfortunately did not prove to be successful enough. the violence continued in South Sudan instead of this agreement. The conflict which began with a political dispute will not be resolved by simply reconciling rival political leaders. The manipulation and atrocities committed by combatants against civilians are likely to have long-term effects.</p>



<p>The world must do everything it can do to treat the symptoms of this emergency but much attention is to be paid to address the root cause of the crisis. The situation in South Sudan is desperate and urgent. The fact that the crisis is man-made means that it is within human power to end it. Currently, millions of lives can be saved which are on the verge of starvation. But the window opportunity is very limited. Humanitarian aid alone cannot end the conflict, nor can it fully respond to the devastating impacts of conflict on individuals, their livelihood, and national economies that have been lingering for decades. But taking a sustainable approach by investing in integrating development efforts such as social protection and social safety can reduce the risk of recurrence of a lethal upcoming crisis. The new approach must prioritize safeguarding livelihoods and institutions as well as saving lives.</p>



<p>The country’s most immediate need is to end the brutal and senseless conflict that has displaced more than one-third of the population so that people can return to their homes and resume farming to prevent additional periods of near-famine conditions. South Sudan’s refugees should receive the same support and attention as refugees from elsewhere. Refugees are an international responsibility; which has to be shared. The refugee protection regime is enhanced through dedicated international cooperation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility-sharing among all states.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Sanitation is more important than independence </strong></p><p>                       <strong>  ~Mahatma Gandhi</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Open defecation is a human practice of defecating outside in a free environment. It has been defined as the practice of defecating in open fields, waterways, and open trenches without any proper disposal of human excreta. The method of open defecation is usually attributed to ancient times when there was no concept of toilets or due to less population, which exerted lesser pressure on surroundings. However, with the increase in population, the practice of open defecation led to some serious health and environmental issues. Due to development and urbanization, more attention was given to health, hygiene, and sanitation, which demanded the elimination of the practice of open defecation.<br>There have been many efforts made by various international bodies, including W.H.O and UNICEF to combat the practice of open defecation across the globe. These international bodies have conducted multiple surveys, prepared reports, and framed policies in order to help the nations across the world to overcome the practice of open defecation.</p>



<h4><strong>Why Do People Defecate in Open?</strong></h4>



<p>There have been many reasons for the human practice of open defecation. Generally, one may attribute this practice to poverty and lack of infrastructure, but there are other motivations for the people to go for the practice of open defecation. We have tried to classify the reasons for Toilet- related and Socio-cultural reasons.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Toilet- related reasons:</strong><br>Toilet related reasons include non- availability of toilets, broken toilets, non-availability of water near toilets, presence of men near toilets, bad smell inside toilets, safety and privacy concerns</li><li><strong>Socio-cultural reasons:</strong><br>Social-cultural motivations include lack of awareness, hesitant to change behavior, habitual of the practice, an act of socialization, preference of being in nature. Some people also say that the practice of open defecation was there during the time of god and goddesses, therefore to defecate inside toilets would go against their religious sentiments. While others believe that defecating in toilets near or inside houses bring bad smell and diseases.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>How is Open Defecation a Problem?</strong></h4>



<p>Open defecation is a taboo topic linked with a number of ill consequences. Emptying vessels in open space demand special attention because research has revealed its harmful effects. Few serious effects of defecating in open space are mentioned below under four heads, viz;<br>1) Health-Related Problems;2) Environmental degradation;<br>3) Attack on Human Dignity; and<br>4) Economic Disadvantages.</p>



<p><strong>1) Health-Related Problems:<br></strong>Defecating in open space induces a large number of flies, which act as disease carriers and spread several contagious diseases to human beings like, Diarrhea, Cholera, Typhoid, etc.. Due to lack of proper sanitation, children suffering from Diarrhea or Cholera or Typhoid, loose appetite, which results in malnutrition among them. The United Nations has reported that the countries where open defecation is practiced at a high rate have the highest number of deaths of children under the age of five because of open defecation. Practicing open defecation may also result in Kidney and bladder infections, as well as hookworm infection.</p>



<p><strong>2) Environmental Degradation:</strong><br>Practicing open defecation has Severeere impact on the environment as well. People, practicing open defecation, generally prefer riverside for nature’s call, which pollutes the river water causing water pollution. Open defecation is also the leading cause of groundwater contamination. Improperly disposed human wastes act as major soil polluters. Stink emitting from human disposal is also hideous and pollutes the surrounding air. Such places seduce large numbers of insects, which act as disease carriers and make the place dull.</p>



<p><strong>3) Attack on Human Dignity:</strong><br>Despite health and environmental impacts, open defecation has another grave and severe impact and that is loss of, human privacy and dignity, specifically for women and girls. The absence of private toilets put women and girls at the risk of sexual harassment and rape. Defecating openly makes them assailable to violence, and that acts as a clog to women empowerment and girl education.</p>



<p><strong>4) Economic Disadvantage:</strong><br>Apart from serious impacts on humans and the environment, the practice of open defecation also affects the economy of a particular country. It handicaps the economic development and growth of a nation. Defecating openly results in a decrease in productivity and the economy of a nation. Poor sanitation practices limit workers&#8217; productivity, longevity, and their ability to invest and save.</p>



<h4><strong>What is World Doing to Stop Open Defecation?</strong></h4>



<p>All the countries across the globe have geared up to combat the practice of open defecation. Different countries have come up with different ideas and policies for ending the practice of open defecation and for providing proper sanitation facilities to their citizens. International bodies like WHO, UNICEF, etc. are playing an active role to help countries across the globe to overcome open defecation. Some of them are:</p>



<p><strong>A) Sustainable Development Goals:</strong></p>



<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG`s) were prepared in 2015 by the UN General Assembly. The SDG 6.2 goal is to provide access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for every person. The SDG 6.2 goal mainly focuses on the elimination of the human practice of defecating in open space by 2030. This goal pays special attention to the sanitation and hygiene facilities of women and children. To pull the menace of open defecation from the bottom, by 2030, it is necessary that at least 60 million people should stop emptying their bowels in open space.</p>



<p><strong>B) Wash Program:</strong></p>



<p>UNICEF/ WHO and various other international bodies at present are conducting a Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) strategy. Over 100 countries out of which 26 high burden countries will be given special focus. These 26 countries are called “game plan countries&#8217; and these game plan countries put almost 90% of the global burden of open defecation. The target of UNICEF&#8217;s game plan is to eradicate open defecation from these 26 countries from its root. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under WASH is also trying to save the lives of people by improving and providing adequate sanitation.</p>



<p><strong>C) World Toilet Day:</strong></p>



<p>World Toilet Day is observed every year on 19th November. It is an official United Nations Observance day. World Toilet Day is celebrated to draw the attention of the world towards the issue of open defecation across the globe. It is used to raise awareness and inspire action to tackle the issue of sanitation crises across the globe.</p>



<p><strong>D) South Asia Conference on Sanitation:</strong></p>



<p>Regional consultations such as the South Asia Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN) are inspiring various advocacy campaigns and political commitment across south Asian countries to address the crisis of open defecation. During the last decade, there has been the greatest increase in the use of toilets. Sanitation revolution is blossoming across the region which is clearly visible in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.</p>



<p><strong>E) Sanitation and Water for All:</strong></p>



<p>Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) is a global partnership that is conducting high-level meetings at both the country, regional, and global levels to address the crisis of open defecation and ways to eliminate it. SWA mainly focuses on motivating and encouraging partners to increase sanitation and hygiene facilities and to ensure adequate financing for the same.<br>Apart from this, several nations are taking speedy steps to eliminate this danger out of their land as soon as possible and to declare themselves as “Open Defecation Free” (ODF).</p>



<h4><strong>Where Does the World Stand in Progress?</strong></h4>



<h4>Current Position:</h4>



<p>The current estimate is that around 12 percent of the global population is practicing open defecation. Despite a lot of efforts by national as well as international bodies, open defecation couldn’t be stopped. Out of 62 countries where almost 5% of the total population is practicing open defecation, only 16 countries are successful to defeat open defecation. However, the nations are still trying to achieve their target and declare themselves as Open defecation free.</p>



<h4>Decline During 2000-2017:</h4>



<p>As per the WHO report, between 2000 and 2017, there is a decline in open defecation rates in all SDG regions except Oceania. While Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand have already achieved the goal of elimination of open defecation, however in all other SDG regions at least 1% of the population still empty their bowels in open space. The largest fall in each SDG region was recorded in Ethiopia, Nepal, Cambodia, Sudan, Kiribati, and the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Countries that already reduced open defecation below 25% by 2000 progressed more slowly, accepting the challenges associated with the target of fully eliminating Open defecation, a total of 16 countries reduced open defecation by over 20 percentage points. Out of these 16 countries, five countries are able to stop open defecation up to 30% while two countries reduced open defecation by over 50 percentage points, as shown in the bar graph. Since 2000, one- third of Nepal’s and Lao People’s Democratic Republic&#8217;s population has been able to switch to toilets for the purpose of defecation. Nearly half of the population of India has stopped emptying their vessels (human excreta) in open space. Over half of the people of Ethiopia and Cambodia has successfully stopped the practice of open defecation. This indicates that people of these regions are giving more importance to the safety of public health than social norms. Data are given in a report which is prepared by WHO mentions that in 2017 almost 45% of the global population used a safely managed sanitation service, 31% of the global population used private sanitation facilities and 14% of the global population used toilets or latrines where human excreta were disposed of unaffected.</p>

<h4><strong>What Needs to be Done to Stop Human Practice of Open Defecation?</strong></h4>



<p>Despite the progress made by the countries to be open defecation free, there are certain reports prepared by WHO which suggest that open defecation is still a menace that needs to be taken care of. As mentioned above out of 60 countries practicing open defecation, only 16 countries have shown positive results while other 44 counties still lag behind.<br>Now, the question that arises is, is it only the responsibility of the government of a particular nation to stop it<code>s</code> people from open defecation? Or are the citizens of a particular nation not responsible to help declare their nation as open defecation free? Or is building toilets and carrying sanitation programs the only possible way to curb this menace? Well, the answer to all these questions lies with the intention, capability, and capacity of the common masses of any nation. A nation is built not by its government or the policies of that government but by its nationals. When the nationals of that very particular state/nation take the oath to build their country clean and free from open defecation, there is no need to spend all the millions and billions of money for that purpose; rather the same money can be used for some other purpose. Like, as we see that globally people of underdeveloped or developing countries participate more in open defecation than developed countries, so the money that these underdeveloped or developing nations receive for sanitation purposes from international bodies. However, the same money can be used in developing the health sector, improved drinking water facilities, nutrition, education, for the protection of children and women, etc. In this way, not only a nation will be open defecation free, but it can develop in many folds.</p>



<h4>Individual Efforts:</h4>



<p>Also, someone has rightly said that charity begins at home, therefore, before suggesting others to stop this menace we all should first check that the same practice isn’t carried out in our own houses by any of our family members. And if done then all we must do is suggest them to stop and warn them about its bad repercussions.</p>



<h4>Community Efforts:</h4>



<p>Next comes the society where we live, we all prefer to live in a clean, healthy environment and for that, we all have to contribute a little. Every society has some norms and rules, and every person living in that society is supposed to follow these rules. Among these entire rules, the first and foremost rule should necessarily be not to defecate in an open space. A person living in a society has a reputation and is under societal pressure; therefore to maintain that reputation, he will surely follow the community rules. </p>



<h4>Efforts By Educational Institutions:</h4>



<p>In schools and also in higher educational institutions students should be given education-related to sanitation, and also the concept of open defecation free nations as a lot of people don&#8217;t know that such a thing even exists. A campaign should be started at the college level, where the students can inform the masses about proper sanitation, and the harmful consequences of open defecation.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>There is a clear difference in the attitudes of people towards emptying vessels. People besides cultural attitudes and social habits should make use of infrastructure considered safe and hygienic by environmental and health standards. The practice of defecating openly has very grave health impacts and concerns to women’s dignity. The matter of open defecation still continues in low and middle-income countries, where lack of resources and limited national budget towards sanitation has clogged the path to provide adequate sanitation facilities to the whole population. Open defecation is not a regional but a global issue that needs to be addressed speedily and effectively. We all can contribute to this cause by developing proper sanitation habits and educating others to do the same. The goal of an open defecation free (ODF) world is possible to achieve and that has been proven by many countries across the globe. Access to proper sanitation is the most essential component of human dignity, health, and well-being. <strong>In 2010 the UN General Assembly under a resolution recognized sanitation as a basic human right</strong>. Along with the obvious health benefits of ending open defecation, countries that have rid themselves of the practice have also enjoyed a huge transformation in social norms and a noticeable reduction in inequality.</p>
