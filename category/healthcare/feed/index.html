<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>



<p>Africa, being a large continent is prone to diverse issues and problems like high prevalence of communicable diseases, low incomes, malnutrition, poorly staffed services, low life expectancy and the like. The most crucial amongst such problems is mental health issues of children which remains unaddressed to a very large extent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of The major causes of growing psychological problems in the continent are increasing poverty, wars, natural disasters and other such sorts of violence and social unrest. It has been revealed that the element of depression alone is going to be the second biggest burden of all health conditions by 2030</p>



<p>In Africa, a plethora of mental health problems exist among children consisting of half of the population of the region. It is estimated that of the children aged between&nbsp; 0 to 9 years, about 3 % suffer from mental disorders. Many suffer from poor psychological development because of neglect either by their mothers or other caretakers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OF CHILDREN</strong></h3>



<p>Child and adolescent mental health is defined by the WHO as the capacity to achieve and maintain optimal psychological functioning and well being. It is directly related to the competence achieved and level reached in psychological and social functioning.</p>



<p>It includes an idea of identity and self-worth, sound family and peer relations, an ability to learn and be productive and capacity to use cultural resources and developmental challenges to maximize development.</p>



<p>However, if there are patterns or changes in thinking, behaving or feeling that causes distress or disrupts a person’s ability to function it implies mental illness or mental health disorder. The&nbsp; mental health disorder includes problems like disruptions or delays in developing age, inappropriate thinking, deviant behaviors, unregulated emotions or social skills which distress children and thereby disrupt their ability to function well in life.</p>



<p>In many African countries, the most usual presentation of psychosis is acute transient psychosis, paranoid psychosis and psychosis resulting from cerebral involvement in infectious diseases which produce temporary disability but may prove to be fatal if not treated properly.</p>



<p>The children growing up in such regions&nbsp; are usually exposed to extremely crucial experiences, who became hardly compatible with physical as well as emotional survival. Unless these toxic environments are addressed by the systems of care, improvement in the mental health of the children is a goal unachievable.</p>



<p>&nbsp;There are some human resources dedicated to the mental health of children. The pushes of the World Health Organization to include mental health in the millennium development goals have improved the profile of child mental health to a very large extent. However, there are certain challenges to the development of appropriate comprehensive child mental health services in Africa. The primary challenges say for instance are socio-economic circumstances and demographic complexities.</p>



<p>In Africa,both a formal as well as informal system of mental health care for children. Though the formal systems of care have been largely eroded by war or poverty but the informal system of care which includes care by family, by indigenous healers or NGO’s are to the large extent developed. For instance, the NGO&#8217;S like The Ape Action Africa, the Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), the Etijah and the like launch certain programs that provide a great help in addressing the issues of orphans and vulnerable and thereby come to the rescue of poor and mentally ill children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for proper care of needy children, both care systems are important and both must work together and complement each other as both are interdependent, for a formal care system can’t effectively address the issue having social context without consulting the informal system of care. Similarly the informal system of care depends on a formal system for specialized training and supervision.</p>



<h3>CURRENT SITUATION IN AFRICA</h3>



<p>In Africa, mental health problems have assumed greater attention. The continent&#8217;s population grew by 49% between 2000 to 2015&nbsp; and is expected to double by next three decades. There is constant pressure on young people who struggle to earn a livelihood in highly competitive labor markets. It is believed that they may face psychological problems because of their failure to realize ambitions or may turn to substance misuse for alleviating their frustrations.</p>



<p>The member states of the world health assembly in 2013, committed to the Mental Health Action Plan, whereby they pledged to enhance service coverage for severe mental health disorders by 20% by 2020 and to reduce suicide rates by 10%.</p>



<p>But the fact remains that health in general is still a poorly funded area of social services in most African countries, morality happening mostly by infectious diseases and malnutrition and morbidity and disablement due to mental illness receive little attention from the government. Mental services in particular continue to be poorly developed with no mental policies, programs or action plans.</p>



<h3>RELIEF PROGRAMS &amp; GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES</h3>



<p>The member states of the African region of the world health organization adopted two resolutions in 1988 and 1990 to improve mental health services with the main aim to formulate mental health policies, programs and action plans.</p>



<p>Two years later, a survey was conducted to see if the countries adopting the resolutions have done anything in this regard. Though there were some modest achievements yet the situation of mental health programs in most of the countries including Africa was unsatisfactory.</p>



<p>WHO in its African Regional Strategy for Mental Health in the year 2020, emphasized that populations in the African region are occupied by various mental and neurological disorders happening to be the major cause of disability. To address this issue, WHO is undertaking a large number of&nbsp; welfare projects with the aim to promote mental health services in Africa by strengthening mental health policies and implementing regional strategies to prompt mental health and thereby prevent mental, psychological and neurological disorders. In the long run, WHO intends to reduce disability associated with mental, psychological and neurological disorders through community based rehabilitation.</p>



<h3>HOW TO SOCIALLY UPLIFT THE AFFECTED?</h3>



<p>Mental disorders are counted among the top ten causes of disability in Africa the burden of which on health issues is going to rise making it inevitable to give this issue the attention and resources it needs.</p>



<p>While planning the system of child mental health care in Africa, two important factors that need to be taken into account include firstly, the moral value system&nbsp; and cultural specific world views of Africa, Asia, Arab and Caucasian people and secondly the social context in which children grow.</p>



<p>It is the need of the hour that authorities in power should develop psychiatry and mental health care. The mental health policies should be strengthened and regional strategies should be adopted and implemented to prompt mental health and mental, neurological and psychological disorders. The drug abuse related problems should be prevented. Community based rehabilitation is required to be launched for reducing disability associated with neurological, mental and psychoactive substances.</p>



<p>People’s perceptions are usually influenced by traditional beliefs in supernatural causes and remedies which leads to unhelpful or health damaging responses to mental illness and stigmatization of mentally ill persons. The negative perception of people as well as policy makers regarding mental and neurological disorders should be changed through various awareness programs and by formulating or reviewing existing legislation in support of mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equitable access should be provided to cost-effective mental, neurological and psychosocial care.</p>



<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>



<p>In order to improve the deteriorating situation of mental health services in Africa, there is dire for authorities to lay focus on the system of health care available for patients in general and children in particular. It should be the priority of the policy makers and authorities in power to make inpatient psychiatric services available at least for children suffering from psychiatric disorders.</p>



<p>Like other countries, the primary health care model has been adopted in Africa long ago but the mental health services were made vertical recently which however is largely based in mental hospitals, catering mainly for adults. Secondary and tertiary outpatient services for children have been started in some areas but only South Africa and Senegal have made inpatient Psychiatric services available for children.</p>



<p>when there is lack of general psychiatric services for children, Other sectors of medical care systems have correspondingly a greater responsibility in meeting mental health needs of patients in Africa and until the general psychiatric services are made available, other sectors are morally under the obligation to step forward and contribute to the humanitarian cause of coming to the rescue of helpless and devastated children. Disciplines like maternal and child health departments, pediatrics, schools, social welfare services, juvenile justice systems and prisons though general, fairly basic and non-specialized but are the obvious ones that have to play a role in contributing to the noble cause of maintaining the mental stability of children.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><strong>&#8220;<em>Healthcare is not a privilege, it is a right. It is a right as fundamental as civil rights. It&#8217;s right as fundamental as giving every child a chance to get a public education. &#8220;</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;~Rod Blagojevich</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields. Physicians and physician associates are part of these health professionals. Dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.</p>



<p><strong>Types of Healthcare:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Primary care</li><li>Secondary care</li><li>Tertiary care</li></ol>



<h4><strong>1. Primary Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>Primary care includes the first place patients go for medical care. It refers to the work of health professionals who act as the first point of consultation for all patients within the health care system.</p>



<p>Primary care team members include:</p>



<ul><li>Primary care doctors also called general practice, general internists, or family doctors</li><li>Pediatricians (doctors for babies and children)</li><li>Nurses</li><li>Physician assistants</li><li>Nurse practitioners</li></ul>



<h4><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Secondary Healthcare&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Secondary care includes acute care: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury, or other health condition. This care is often found in a hospital emergency department. Secondary care also includes skilled attendance during childbirth, intensive care, and medical imaging services.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;secondary care&#8221; is sometimes used synonymously with &#8220;hospital care&#8221;. However, many secondary care providers, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, most dental specialties or physiotherapists, do not necessarily work in hospitals.</p>



<h4><strong>3.  Tertiary Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>This type of healthcare is known as specialized consultative healthcare usually for inpatients and on referral from primary and secondary healthcare for advanced medical investigation and treatment. The following examples of tertiary care services are plastic surgery, burn treatment, cardiac surgery, cancer management, neurosurgery, complex medical and surgical interventions, etc.</p>



<h4>Health System</h4>



<p>A <strong>health system</strong> is an organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to meet the health needs of target populations.</p>



<h4><strong>Key Components of a Well Functioning Health System</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>As per WHO a well functioning health system responds in a balanced way to a population’s needs and expectations by:&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Improving the health status of individuals, families and communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Defending the population against what threatens its health.</p>



<p>• Protecting people against the financial consequences of ill-health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Providing equitable access to people-centered care.</p>



<p>• Making it possible for people to participate in decisions affecting their health and health system.</p>



<p>Thus it also includes the healthcare facilities being affordable to people despite their financial conditions.</p>



<h4><strong>What Does Affordability Mean?</strong></h4>



<p>Although the “affordability” of healthcare is a common concern, the term is rarely defined. Affordability is fundamentally a function of income, spending, and judgments about the value of goods and services for their price. Affordability is mostly taken as an economic concept.</p>



<p>Much of today’s health care focus centers on the rising costs of healthcare. Today’s challenging economic situation has redirected much of the health care discussion to affordability, not simply health care costs.</p>



<p>As a generic term, affordability can best be defined as a measure of someone’s ability to purchase a good or service. It describes whether a person or organization is able to make a purchase without unacceptable or unreasonable sacrifices, with limited sources.&nbsp;Similarly, taking simple definition <strong>Healthcare Affordability </strong>generally describes whether a person or organization has sufficient income to pay for or provide for health care costs. These costs could be insurance premiums or direct health care service costs.</p>



<p>Health care would be affordable if all the classes of society are able to pay for the delivery of the service or when the states spend a high economy on the health systems and provide it at low costs or free of costs or through insurance and fundings.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Basis for Affordable Healthcare</h4>



<h4>1.   <strong>Right to Health</strong></h4>



<p>The right to health is the economic, social, and cultural right to a universal minimum standard of health to which all individuals are entitled. The concept of a right to health has been enumerated in international agreements which include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>



<ul><li>The Constitution of <strong>WHO </strong>defines the right to health as &#8220;the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health,&#8221; and enumerates some principles of this right as healthy child development; equitable dissemination of medical knowledge and its benefits; and government-provided social measures to ensure adequate health.</li><li>Article 25 of the United Nations&#8217; 1948 <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> states that &#8220;Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care and necessary social services.&#8221;&nbsp;</li><li>Understanding health as a human right creates a legal obligation on states to ensure access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality as well as to providing for the underlying determinants of health, such as safe and potable water, sanitation, food, housing, health-related information and education, and gender equality.</li><li>A States’ obligation to support the right to health – including through the allocation of “maximum available resources” to progressively realize this goal &#8211; is reviewed through various international human rights mechanisms, such as the Universal Periodic Review, or the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In many cases, the right to health has been adopted into domestic law or Constitutional law.</li><li>A rights-based approach to health requires that health policy and programs must prioritize the needs of those furthest behind first towards greater equity, a principle that has been echoed in the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Health Coverage.</li><li>The right to health must be enjoyed without discrimination on the grounds of race, age, ethnicity, or any other status. Non-discrimination and equality requires states to take steps to redress any discriminatory law, practice, or policy</li><li>Another feature of rights-based approaches is meaningful participation. Participation means ensuring that national stakeholders – including non-state actors such as non-governmental organizations – are meaningfully involved in all phases of programming: assessment, analysis, planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>2.   Core Components of the Right to Health</strong></h4>



<p>The right to health (Article 12) as defined in General Comment 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – a committee of Independent Experts, responsible for overseeing adherence to the Covenant. (4) The right includes the following core components:</p>



<ul><li>Availability&nbsp;</li><li>Accessibility&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Accessibility has four overlapping dimensions:</p>



<ul><li>non-discrimination</li><li>physical accessibility</li><li>economical accessibility (affordability)</li><li>information accessibility.</li><li>Acceptability&nbsp;</li><li>Quality</li></ul>



<h4>Why is Affordable Healthcare Needed?</h4>



<p>Affordable healthcare is needed because most of the population of the world is either poor or fall below the poverty line. Health conditions and complications do not affect only the rich and economically stable. These can befall anyone and every person whether poor or rich should get all the proper treatment and care required. For that reason, it is necessary that healthcare should be affordable to every irrespective of economical status.</p>



<p>Many health treatments like cardiosurgeries, neurosurgeries, diabetes treatment are costly and thus people who are economically weak are unable to afford these treatments which are necessary for their survival. Thus it is important that medical care should be affordable to all classes of society without financial hindrance.</p>



<p>The states need to spend more on healthcare systems to make it affordable for all.</p>



<p><strong>Healthcare can be affordable in two ways:</strong></p>



<ul><li>When the cost of delivery of medical care is low.</li><li>When people are able to pay for the treatments which can be easy when the government would finance healthcare particularly for the poor.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Universal Health Coverage</strong></h4>



<p>There should be a universal health coverage. According to WHO Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It includes the full range of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.</p>



<p>Currently, at least half of the people in the world do not receive the health services they need. About 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year because of out-of-pocket spending on health. This must change.</p>



<p>To make health for all a reality, we need individuals and communities who have access to high-quality health services so that they take care of their own health and the health of their families; skilled health workers providing quality, people-centered care; and policy-makers committed to investing in universal health coverage.</p>



<p>Universal health coverage should be based on strong, people-centered primary health care. Good health systems are rooted in the communities they serve. They focus not only on preventing and treating disease and illness but also on helping to improve well-being and quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>Asia/Pacific Health Coverage : An analysis of 2018 report :&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Health Status</strong></li></ul>



<p>Between 2000 and 2015, the average maternal mortality rate across lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries was cut by more than half, but it is still high at 140 deaths per 100 000 live births.</p>



<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in Asia-Pacific. In 2016, there were 10.4 million newly occurring (incident) TB cases worldwide, 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative people globally. One-third of new cases and one-fourth of deaths were estimated in India and Indonesia alone.</p>



<p>The share of deaths due to non-communicable diseases is increasing in Asia-Pacific. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers were the most common causes of death, being responsible for over 82% and 78% of all deaths, on average, across high and upper-middle-income Asia-Pacific countries.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Healthcare Resources</strong></li></ul>



<p>The supply of doctors is one per 1000&nbsp; across lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries and 1.2 per 1000 population – is reported in upper-middle-income countries.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The number of nurses is highest in high-income countries such as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, with over ten nurses per 1000 population. The supply is much lower in a number of low-income countries, including Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, where there are 0.5 nurses or less per 1000 population.</p>



<p>The number of hospital beds per capita is 2.8 and 1.8 per 1000 population on average across upper-middle and lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries respectively, lower than high-income Asia-Pacific countries average of 5.3, but it varies considerably.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Healthcare Spending</strong></li></ul>



<p>Lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries spend just below USD 200 per person per year on health, against USD 670 and USD 3 450 in upper-middle-income and high-income Asia-Pacific countries respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This amounts to over 4.3% of gross domestic product, on average, in middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries, compared to over 7.3% in high-income Asia-Pacific countries in 2015.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, high-income countries reported an increase of 0.8 percentage points from 2010-2015, twice the increase reported by middle and low-income countries at 0.4 percentage points.</p>



<p>The share of public spending in total health spending increased in all Asia-Pacific countries from 2010 to 2015, but it is much lower in lower-middle and low-income Asia-Pacific countries compared to upper-middle and high-income Asia-Pacific countries: 41.9% compared to 62% and 72.3%, respectively<strong>.</strong> Although there is some improvement in Asia-Pacific countries in the last years but yet not up to the mark. Countries in the Asia/Pacific region need to step up their efforts to give more people access to affordable, quality health care, suggests the 2018 report.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Management </strong>O<strong>f Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of policies and plans adopted by the government, private sector business, and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, pharmaceuticals, health human resources, and public health.</p>



<p>Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health are also important subfields.</p>



<p>Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of aging, and health inequities, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a vaccination policy, supporting public health programs in providing vaccinations to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.</p>



<p>The rapid emergence of many chronic diseases, which require costly long-term care and treatment, is making many health managers and policymakers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is HIV/AIDS. Another major public health concern is diabetes. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of tobacco smoking, linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.</p>



<p>Antibiotic resistance is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as tuberculosis. The World Health Organization, for its World Health Day 2011 campaign, is calling for an intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines for future generations.</p>



<h4><strong>Steps to Make Healthcare Affordable:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<ol><li><strong>Increase Spending on Healthcare:&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>There is not enough investment in the field of healthcare. Investment in public health departments needs to be made as most of these institutions are inefficient in providing services due to which people have to turn to private institutions. Early detection of diseases by providing better services through these public healthcare facilities can help in the efficient treatment and save subsequent expenditure.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Invest in Innovation and Technology:</strong></p>



<p>Innovation can help in driving down costs and offer improvements in the quality of healthcare. Certain measures like procuring, testing, and distributing generic medicines to public hospitals at low costs should be implemented.</p>



<p> 3.<strong> Subsidies and Benefits:</strong></p>



<p>Organizations that manufacture low-cost devices can be attracted to set up hubs by providing subsidies and developing hassle-free policies for ease of business. This will help the weaker sections to afford the proper healthcare e.g the biggest players in the medical diagnostic device field namely, Philips, GE, and Siemens manufacture low-cost devices in India.</p>



<p> 4.<strong> </strong>Health insurance policies help the individual by making <strong>medical expenditures affordable</strong>.&nbsp; Such policies should be supported by the government of all countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p> 5<strong>.</strong> <strong>Medical Loan:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Medical Loan is another step that will make healthcare accessible whenever the need is felt. The government should make medical loans easily available and accessible to all. Such loans should be simple, without any documentary and other formalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong> </strong>6.<strong> </strong>The healthcare system of a country should be affordable to all particularly to low and moderate-income families. It should be <strong>sustainably </strong>and<strong> justly financed.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong> </strong>7<strong>. Build the National Digital Infrastructure:</strong> </p>



<p>Governments must invest in the necessary telecommunications infrastructure that underlies an eHealth strategy.</p>



<p> 8. <strong>Invest in Human Capital:</strong></p>



<p>Governments and the private sector should share a mutual interest in and responsibility for training medical personnel and civil servants in technology capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p> 9. <strong>Develop a Regulatory and Legal Framework:</strong></p>



<p>Parliament or the national assembly cements a mandate for digitizing healthcare in national legislation, protecting patients, and enabling innovation.</p>



<p><strong> 10.</strong> <strong>Appoint an eHealth Government Agency:</strong></p>



<p>A centralized agency is best positioned to coordinate national eHealth projects across ministries; across the district, provincial, and federal levels of government; and with patient associations, medical associations, and businesses.</p>



<h4><strong>C</strong>onclusion</h4>



<p>Health care is one of the most essential topics in the world today. Providing affordable and accessible healthcare to one and all are very important and various steps have been taken and policies framed in this direction. But, there is a need for better planning and execution to make healthcare facilities affordable for the large population through better policy decisions.</p>



<p>Affordability need not merely be met with finance capital or the ability to pay, it needs to be also viewed through the lens of the ability to seek services which make sense and appeal to the masses and the classes. When health care is more affordable, more people have access to health care.</p>



<p>That’s why health plans are laser-focused on making health care more affordable by changing the way that we pay for products and services and promoting reforms that provide more value for consumers and employers.</p>



<p>States should follow policies that create pricing transparency, ensure a competitive marketplace, promote value-based payment, and provide flexibility for health plans to offer products that meet the needs of our customers.</p>

<h3><strong>I</strong>ntroduction</h3>



<p>Alcohol is a drink that contains the recreational drug ethanol. Alcohol is classified as a ‘sedative hypnotic’ drug, which means it acts to depress the central nervous system at high doses. Alcohol has medicinal value and is used e.g in the treatment of cough, to keep the body warm in winter, etc., however, it has dangerous effects much more than it benefits as a drink. At lower doses, alcohol can act as a stimulant, which may induce feelings of euphoria and talkativeness, however drinking too much alcohol at a time can lead to drowsiness, respiratory depression (where breathing becomes slow, shallow, or stops entirely), coma, or even death.</p>



<p>This writeup will deal with the dangerous effect of alcohol on the body and will try to analyze how alcohol is killing the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What Happens by Intake of Alcohol</strong>?</h4>



<p>After the intake of alcohol, it is rapidly absorbed into the blood (20% through the stomach and 80% through the small intestine). It usually peaks in the blood after 30-90 minutes and is carried through all the organs of the body.</p>



<p>Alcohol may cause following effects on the body:</p>



<ul><li>Blurred and double vision</li><li>Slurred and confused speech</li><li>Loss of minerals and salt through urine</li><li>Clumsiness and difficulty in walking</li><li>Mood changes</li><li>Loss of memory</li><li>Disrupted sleep&nbsp;</li><li>Nausea and vomiting etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Alcohol is a cause of many health conditions and, for almost all conditions, heavier alcohol use means a higher risk of disease or injury. Drinking alcohol regularly over time and in a pattern of heavy single drinking sessions, alcohol can cause a variety of health conditions. These include cancers and other conditions such as liver disease, which can even lead to permanent liver damage due to alcohol.</p>



<h4><strong>Social Impact of Alcohol Consumption</strong></h4>



<ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>Effect of Alcoholism on Family:</strong></li></ul>



<p>Researches have shown that alcohol abuse has led to many adverse effects in the families e. g., it causes domestic violence, causes families&#8217; financial problems, impairs decision-making skills, and plays a role in child neglect and abuse. Spousal violence is more likely, not only when a partner is alcohol dependent or a problem drinker, but also when the partner is an infrequent drinker who occasionally drinks heavily.</p>



<p>The impact of drinking on family life can include substantial mental health problems for other family members, such as anxiety, fear, and depression.</p>



<p>Drinking outside the home can mean less time spent at home. The financial costs of alcohol purchase and medical treatment, as well as lost wages, can leave other family members destitute.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Effect of Alcohol on Children:</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>~</strong>Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of the most common direct consequences of parental alcohol, caused by alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy. Children with FAS display a variety of symptoms, many of which are life-long and permanent.</p>



<p><strong>~</strong>Children who grow up in a home with a loved one dealing with alcohol addiction may be affected as well; they are at significant to develop alcohol use disorders themselves.</p>



<p><strong>~</strong>Growing up in a home where at least one parent has a severe alcohol use disorder can increase a child&#8217;s chances of developing psychological and emotional problems e. g, abuse, depression, mood swings, etc.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Effect of Alcoholism on Work Performance:</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Alcohol consumption can affect work performance in several ways:</p>



<p><strong>Absences</strong> &#8211; There is ample evidence that people with alcohol dependence and drinking problems are on sick leave more frequently than other employees, with a significant cost to employees, employers, and social security systems.</p>



<p><strong>Productivity: </strong>Heavy drinking at work may reduce productivity. Performance at work may be affected both by the volume and pattern of drinking. Heavy drinkers have lower performance, problems in personal relationships, and lack of self-direction.</p>



<p><strong>Work accidents: </strong>In different parts of the world a high number of work accidents have been attributed to alcohol use.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Crime Rate :</strong></li></ul>



<p>Alcohol leads to intoxication, by which a person is not able to distinguish between right and wrong, and thereby there are many chances of a person indulging in criminal activity when he is intoxicated. Because of this, alcohol-related violence and crime rates are on the rise throughout the country.</p>



<p>For example, an estimated 37 percent of sexual assaults and rapes are committed by offenders who were under the influence of alcohol. Similarly, according to research, about 40 percent of convicted murderers had used alcohol before or during the crime, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NXq7HmekkHLKfBwJ11nKxT070euH44-pDn1ufYvZ5HlLIVG9yl1smz9d2VbPoRJlDuztV24ZJBsEnEJ3BzG4TRZUGskOFrbkIeVSh9cYvWlxWbbbtlOeIKVPmOMNcmoxG2Dmjw" alt=""/></figure>



<h4><strong>Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Alcohol consumption contributes to 3 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, the harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 5.1% of the global burden of disease.</p>



<p>According to the Global status report on alcohol and health 2018 released by WHO more than 3 million people died as a result of harmful use of alcohol in 2016. This represents 1 in 20 deaths. More than three-quarters of these deaths were among men. Overall, the harmful use of alcohol causes more than 5% of the global disease burden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all deaths attributable to alcohol, 28% were due to injuries, such as those from traffic crashes, self-harm, and interpersonal violence; 21% due to digestive disorders; 19% due to cardiovascular diseases, and the remainder due to infectious diseases, cancers, mental disorders, and other health conditions.</p>



<p>Globally an estimated 237 million men and 46 million women suffer from alcohol-use disorders with the highest prevalence among men and women in the European region (14.8% and 3.5%) and the Region of Americas (11.5% and 5.1%). Alcohol-use disorders are more common in high-income countries.</p>

<h4><strong>Policies and Strategies</strong></h4>



<p>For long time policies and strategies have been framed with regard to alcohol consumption.</p>



<h4><strong>Global Strategy to Reduce&nbsp; Harmful&nbsp; Use of&nbsp; Alcohol,2010</strong></h4>



<p>The WHO in 2010, provided a global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol which seeks to improve the health and social outcomes for individuals, families, and communities, with considerably reduced morbidity and mortality due to the harmful use of alcohol and their ensuing social consequences. It is envisaged that the global strategy will promote and support local, regional, and global actions to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol.</p>



<p>The global strategy focuses on ten key areas of policy options and interventions at the national level. The ten areas for national action are:</p>



<ol><li>Leadership, awareness, and commitment.</li><li>Health services&#8217; response.</li><li>Community action.</li><li>Drink-driving policies and countermeasures.</li><li>Availability of alcohol.</li><li>Marketing of alcoholic beverages.</li><li>Pricing policies.</li><li>Reducing the negative consequences of drinking and alcohol intoxication.</li><li>Reducing the public health impact of illicit alcohol and informally produced alcohol.</li><li>Monitoring and surveillance.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>Global Alcohol Policy Alliance&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>In 2001 the <strong>Global Alcohol Policy Alliance </strong>was established.</p>



<p>The&nbsp; Global Alcohol Policy Alliance is a developing network of non-government organizations and people working in public health agencies who share information on alcohol issues and advocate evidence-based alcohol policies</p>



<h4><strong>Mission Statement</strong></h4>



<p>The GAPA mission is to reduce alcohol-related harm worldwide by promoting science-based policies independent of commercial interests.</p>



<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Provide a forum for alcohol policy advocates through meetings, information sharing, publications, and electronic communications; with the purpose to disseminate information internationally on effective alcohol policies and policy advocacy;</li><li>Bring to the attention of national governments, international governmental and non-governmental agencies and communities the social, economic, and health consequences of alcohol consumption and related harm; with the purpose to advocate for international and national governmental and non-governmental efforts to reduce alcohol-related harm worldwide;</li><li>Co-operate with national and local organizations and communities to alleviate alcohol-related problems;</li><li>Encourage international research on the social and health impact of the actions of the multinational alcohol beverage industry;</li><li>Monitor and promote research on the impact of international trade agreements on alcohol-related harm;</li><li>Monitor the activities of the alcoholic beverage industry;</li><li>Place priority on research and advocacy regarding those parts of the world where alcohol problems are increasing;</li><li>Ensure that member groups in those areas have the technology and support capacity to participate in a global network for communication and action.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>The Global Alcohol Policy Conference</strong></h4>



<p>The GAPA holds the <strong>Global Alcohol Policy Conference, </strong>which is the leading forum for the world’s alcohol policymakers, advocates, researchers, civil society activists, and practitioners. The 6th Global Alcohol Policy Conference was held in Dublin Ireland in early March, marking the 20th anniversary of the first GAPC.</p>



<h5><strong>GAPA principles for advocacy during the WHO process to accelerate action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol 2020 – 2022</strong></h5>



<p>Following a decision at the World Health Organisation 146th Executive Board WHO will start a two-year process to “accelerate action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol”. This includes a consultation towards an action plan 2022-2030 for the global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol; development of a technical report on the harmful use of alcohol-related to cross-border alcohol marketing; a call for more resources to be made available; and a review of the Global strategy in 2030. Civil society has an important role to play in contributing to consultations and communicating with decision-makers about what such an accelerated action will entail. GAPA and its global network will participate actively in the two-year process and beyond.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Alcohol consumption has increased since past years which is turning fatal for the populations worldwide. Reports already throw light on how many people die because of alcohol consumption. To some people, it may appear like a cool habit to follow and to others an escape from the worries of life which eventually ends up with the addiction. But beyond every worry or habit, what matters is the precious life of a person which is a blessing. Even if life is spared, it causes several serious health issues that interrupt the normal mechanism of life and eats up your economy as well. It also leads to social disorder and leaves long-termed impacts on children or partners who are victims of alcohol violence. Although international policies have been framed, states must follow up with strong domestic control measures.</p>



<p>Even though the prevalence of alcohol use in the world is very high, it has not been brought under legal control contrary to other substances like cocaine, cannabis, etc.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s high time that the governments could treat alcohol as other narcotic drugs and calls for legislation for the control of alcohol uniformly across the world, as a public health policy.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Open defecation is a human practice of defecating outside in a free environment. It has been defined as the practice of defecating in open fields, waterways, and open trenches without any proper disposal of human excreta. The method of open defecation is usually attributed to ancient times when there was no concept of toilets or due to less population, which exerted lesser pressure on surroundings. However, with the increase in population, the practice of open defecation led to some serious health and environmental issues. Due to development and urbanization, more attention was given to health, hygiene, and sanitation, which demanded the elimination of the practice of open defecation.<br>There have been many efforts made by various international bodies, including W.H.O and UNICEF to combat the practice of open defecation across the globe. These international bodies have conducted multiple surveys, prepared reports, and framed policies in order to help the nations across the world to overcome the practice of open defecation.</p>



<h4><strong>Why Do People Defecate in Open?</strong></h4>



<p>There have been many reasons for the human practice of open defecation. Generally, one may attribute this practice to poverty and lack of infrastructure, but there are other motivations for the people to go for the practice of open defecation. We have tried to classify the reasons for Toilet- related and Socio-cultural reasons.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Toilet- related reasons:</strong><br>Toilet related reasons include non- availability of toilets, broken toilets, non-availability of water near toilets, presence of men near toilets, bad smell inside toilets, safety and privacy concerns</li><li><strong>Socio-cultural reasons:</strong><br>Social-cultural motivations include lack of awareness, hesitant to change behavior, habitual of the practice, an act of socialization, preference of being in nature. Some people also say that the practice of open defecation was there during the time of god and goddesses, therefore to defecate inside toilets would go against their religious sentiments. While others believe that defecating in toilets near or inside houses bring bad smell and diseases.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>How is Open Defecation a Problem?</strong></h4>



<p>Open defecation is a taboo topic linked with a number of ill consequences. Emptying vessels in open space demand special attention because research has revealed its harmful effects. Few serious effects of defecating in open space are mentioned below under four heads, viz;<br>1) Health-Related Problems;2) Environmental degradation;<br>3) Attack on Human Dignity; and<br>4) Economic Disadvantages.</p>



<p><strong>1) Health-Related Problems:<br></strong>Defecating in open space induces a large number of flies, which act as disease carriers and spread several contagious diseases to human beings like, Diarrhea, Cholera, Typhoid, etc.. Due to lack of proper sanitation, children suffering from Diarrhea or Cholera or Typhoid, loose appetite, which results in malnutrition among them. The United Nations has reported that the countries where open defecation is practiced at a high rate have the highest number of deaths of children under the age of five because of open defecation. Practicing open defecation may also result in Kidney and bladder infections, as well as hookworm infection.</p>



<p><strong>2) Environmental Degradation:</strong><br>Practicing open defecation has Severeere impact on the environment as well. People, practicing open defecation, generally prefer riverside for nature’s call, which pollutes the river water causing water pollution. Open defecation is also the leading cause of groundwater contamination. Improperly disposed human wastes act as major soil polluters. Stink emitting from human disposal is also hideous and pollutes the surrounding air. Such places seduce large numbers of insects, which act as disease carriers and make the place dull.</p>



<p><strong>3) Attack on Human Dignity:</strong><br>Despite health and environmental impacts, open defecation has another grave and severe impact and that is loss of, human privacy and dignity, specifically for women and girls. The absence of private toilets put women and girls at the risk of sexual harassment and rape. Defecating openly makes them assailable to violence, and that acts as a clog to women empowerment and girl education.</p>



<p><strong>4) Economic Disadvantage:</strong><br>Apart from serious impacts on humans and the environment, the practice of open defecation also affects the economy of a particular country. It handicaps the economic development and growth of a nation. Defecating openly results in a decrease in productivity and the economy of a nation. Poor sanitation practices limit workers&#8217; productivity, longevity, and their ability to invest and save.</p>



<h4><strong>What is World Doing to Stop Open Defecation?</strong></h4>



<p>All the countries across the globe have geared up to combat the practice of open defecation. Different countries have come up with different ideas and policies for ending the practice of open defecation and for providing proper sanitation facilities to their citizens. International bodies like WHO, UNICEF, etc. are playing an active role to help countries across the globe to overcome open defecation. Some of them are:</p>



<p><strong>A) Sustainable Development Goals:</strong></p>



<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG`s) were prepared in 2015 by the UN General Assembly. The SDG 6.2 goal is to provide access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for every person. The SDG 6.2 goal mainly focuses on the elimination of the human practice of defecating in open space by 2030. This goal pays special attention to the sanitation and hygiene facilities of women and children. To pull the menace of open defecation from the bottom, by 2030, it is necessary that at least 60 million people should stop emptying their bowels in open space.</p>



<p><strong>B) Wash Program:</strong></p>



<p>UNICEF/ WHO and various other international bodies at present are conducting a Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) strategy. Over 100 countries out of which 26 high burden countries will be given special focus. These 26 countries are called “game plan countries&#8217; and these game plan countries put almost 90% of the global burden of open defecation. The target of UNICEF&#8217;s game plan is to eradicate open defecation from these 26 countries from its root. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under WASH is also trying to save the lives of people by improving and providing adequate sanitation.</p>



<p><strong>C) World Toilet Day:</strong></p>



<p>World Toilet Day is observed every year on 19th November. It is an official United Nations Observance day. World Toilet Day is celebrated to draw the attention of the world towards the issue of open defecation across the globe. It is used to raise awareness and inspire action to tackle the issue of sanitation crises across the globe.</p>



<p><strong>D) South Asia Conference on Sanitation:</strong></p>



<p>Regional consultations such as the South Asia Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN) are inspiring various advocacy campaigns and political commitment across south Asian countries to address the crisis of open defecation. During the last decade, there has been the greatest increase in the use of toilets. Sanitation revolution is blossoming across the region which is clearly visible in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.</p>



<p><strong>E) Sanitation and Water for All:</strong></p>



<p>Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) is a global partnership that is conducting high-level meetings at both the country, regional, and global levels to address the crisis of open defecation and ways to eliminate it. SWA mainly focuses on motivating and encouraging partners to increase sanitation and hygiene facilities and to ensure adequate financing for the same.<br>Apart from this, several nations are taking speedy steps to eliminate this danger out of their land as soon as possible and to declare themselves as “Open Defecation Free” (ODF).</p>



<h4><strong>Where Does the World Stand in Progress?</strong></h4>



<h4>Current Position:</h4>



<p>The current estimate is that around 12 percent of the global population is practicing open defecation. Despite a lot of efforts by national as well as international bodies, open defecation couldn’t be stopped. Out of 62 countries where almost 5% of the total population is practicing open defecation, only 16 countries are successful to defeat open defecation. However, the nations are still trying to achieve their target and declare themselves as Open defecation free.</p>



<h4>Decline During 2000-2017:</h4>



<p>As per the WHO report, between 2000 and 2017, there is a decline in open defecation rates in all SDG regions except Oceania. While Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand have already achieved the goal of elimination of open defecation, however in all other SDG regions at least 1% of the population still empty their bowels in open space. The largest fall in each SDG region was recorded in Ethiopia, Nepal, Cambodia, Sudan, Kiribati, and the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Countries that already reduced open defecation below 25% by 2000 progressed more slowly, accepting the challenges associated with the target of fully eliminating Open defecation, a total of 16 countries reduced open defecation by over 20 percentage points. Out of these 16 countries, five countries are able to stop open defecation up to 30% while two countries reduced open defecation by over 50 percentage points, as shown in the bar graph. Since 2000, one- third of Nepal’s and Lao People’s Democratic Republic&#8217;s population has been able to switch to toilets for the purpose of defecation. Nearly half of the population of India has stopped emptying their vessels (human excreta) in open space. Over half of the people of Ethiopia and Cambodia has successfully stopped the practice of open defecation. This indicates that people of these regions are giving more importance to the safety of public health than social norms. Data are given in a report which is prepared by WHO mentions that in 2017 almost 45% of the global population used a safely managed sanitation service, 31% of the global population used private sanitation facilities and 14% of the global population used toilets or latrines where human excreta were disposed of unaffected.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="448" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nC3t8dq0zD13kQ9qr1FAPwFzeSJnM7cfqozjULUGphM7LKadlAUzHxYBRAYuwT6fBPxrX9KreM41laLoaakwUmjAFRLquRXCsXh9YZ5p76Qa-A24HhhQxIHt3TlKs7hb5qfthQ"></p>



<h4><strong>What Needs to be Done to Stop Human Practice of Open Defecation?</strong></h4>



<p>Despite the progress made by the countries to be open defecation free, there are certain reports prepared by WHO which suggest that open defecation is still a menace that needs to be taken care of. As mentioned above out of 60 countries practicing open defecation, only 16 countries have shown positive results while other 44 counties still lag behind.<br>Now, the question that arises is, is it only the responsibility of the government of a particular nation to stop it<code>s</code> people from open defecation? Or are the citizens of a particular nation not responsible to help declare their nation as open defecation free? Or is building toilets and carrying sanitation programs the only possible way to curb this menace? Well, the answer to all these questions lies with the intention, capability, and capacity of the common masses of any nation. A nation is built not by its government or the policies of that government but by its nationals. When the nationals of that very particular state/nation take the oath to build their country clean and free from open defecation, there is no need to spend all the millions and billions of money for that purpose; rather the same money can be used for some other purpose. Like, as we see that globally people of underdeveloped or developing countries participate more in open defecation than developed countries, so the money that these underdeveloped or developing nations receive for sanitation purposes from international bodies. However, the same money can be used in developing the health sector, improved drinking water facilities, nutrition, education, for the protection of children and women, etc. In this way, not only a nation will be open defecation free, but it can develop in many folds.</p>



<h4>Individual Efforts:</h4>



<p>Also, someone has rightly said that charity begins at home, therefore, before suggesting others to stop this menace we all should first check that the same practice isn’t carried out in our own houses by any of our family members. And if done then all we must do is suggest them to stop and warn them about its bad repercussions.</p>



<h4>Community Efforts:</h4>



<p>Next comes the society where we live, we all prefer to live in a clean, healthy environment and for that, we all have to contribute a little. Every society has some norms and rules, and every person living in that society is supposed to follow these rules. Among these entire rules, the first and foremost rule should necessarily be not to defecate in an open space. A person living in a society has a reputation and is under societal pressure; therefore to maintain that reputation, he will surely follow the community rules. </p>



<h4>Efforts By Educational Institutions:</h4>



<p>In schools and also in higher educational institutions students should be given education-related to sanitation, and also the concept of open defecation free nations as a lot of people don&#8217;t know that such a thing even exists. A campaign should be started at the college level, where the students can inform the masses about proper sanitation, and the harmful consequences of open defecation.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>There is a clear difference in the attitudes of people towards emptying vessels. People besides cultural attitudes and social habits should make use of infrastructure considered safe and hygienic by environmental and health standards. The practice of defecating openly has very grave health impacts and concerns to women’s dignity. The matter of open defecation still continues in low and middle-income countries, where lack of resources and limited national budget towards sanitation has clogged the path to provide adequate sanitation facilities to the whole population. Open defecation is not a regional but a global issue that needs to be addressed speedily and effectively. We all can contribute to this cause by developing proper sanitation habits and educating others to do the same. The goal of an open defecation free (ODF) world is possible to achieve and that has been proven by many countries across the globe. Access to proper sanitation is the most essential component of human dignity, health, and well-being. <strong>In 2010 the UN General Assembly under a resolution recognized sanitation as a basic human right</strong>. Along with the obvious health benefits of ending open defecation, countries that have rid themselves of the practice have also enjoyed a huge transformation in social norms and a noticeable reduction in inequality.</p>
